Robison/HOU/ECT@ECT, Dale Neuner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven M Elliott/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: On-line GTC's for Enron Petrochemicals Company (EPC) Mark - Last week Dale Neuner was requested to add four new commodities to on-line trading and Mike Robison and Steve Elliott have reviewed and approved the long descriptions for benzene, mixed xylene, toluene and methanol.   We have also finalized the form of GTC's for EPC (who trades benzene, xylene and toluene) and are forwarding them to you for further distribution. Note:  GTC's for Enron Clean Fuels Company (who trades methanol) will follow on Wednesday. Thanks. Nony Flores Ext. 3-7541 I have been able to access this but our outside legal counsel (Sullivan & Cromwell in NY) can't.  Any way for them to get access so they can advise us on this?  They are also the guys who will help with a training session on various legal issues and company policies in trading. Michael Etringer We have an opening for a paralegal in the Financial Trading group.  In the past we have been very successful with referrals from members of the Legal Dept. who know of paralegals with whom they have worked in local law firms who might be willing to move.  Please give this a little thought and if you know of a good paralegal in town, let me or Tana Jones know so we can contact them. Thanks for you help. Mark I thought your Mom might like the first three.
