Reference=20 Entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2. =20 2. Consent =01* Enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai= n=20 types of Reference Entities before including them in the list of Reference= =20 Entities. ? In particular, consent should be obtained from any Reference Entities wit= h=20 which Enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or= =20 other services that could result in Enron being considered a fiduciary of t= he=20 Reference Entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha= t=20 could be violated if the Reference Entity does not consent to the arrangeme= nt. ? Enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20 counterparties to which Enron merely provides prices and with which Enron= =20 trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar= =20 services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations. ? Where consent is sought, Enron should include a request that the Referenc= e=20 Entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20 included in the list of Reference Entities.  If a Reference Entity fails or= =20 refuses to execute the letter, Enron will need to make a determination, on = a=20 case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o= n=20 the list of Reference Entities.  However, it should be recognized that, by= =20 requesting consent, Enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as= a=20 Reference Entity in the absence of consent. 3. Chinese Wall =01* We understand that it will not be feasible to construc= t a=20 complete =01&Chinese Wall=018 between the operations related to the Product= and=20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  This is due primarily to the fact tha= t=20 activities related to the Product will utilize the same credit function as= =20 Enron=01,s other trading activities.  However, Enron should implement a mod= ified=20 Chinese Wall between the trading operations.  This approach would enhance= =20 Enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety= or=20 breach of duty by facilitating Enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20 Product. This could be accomplished through a number of procedures. ? First, Enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the Produc= t,=20 on the one hand, and Enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand= . =20 Even if personnel involved in the Product are located on the same floor as= =20 other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the= =20 floor set off by partitions or similar features. ? Second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio= n=20 between Product traders and other traders if such information is material t= o=20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20 domain.  In addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe= ct=20 to the procedures through training programs.
