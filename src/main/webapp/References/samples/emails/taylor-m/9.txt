? Finally, senior supervisory officers of Enron should be assigned to monit= or=20 communications between the groups of traders and to review and make=20 determinations on requests by traders to communicate information that would= =20 otherwise be prohibited under the procedures.  These procedures will be=20 similar to those that have been developed in connection with Enron=01,s equ= ity=20 trading activities. 4. Restricted List -- Enron should establish and maintain a =01&restricted = list=018=20 of those entities on which Products may not be traded. ? Initially, the list could be used to exclude those entities on which it i= s=20 not feasible for Enron to offer Products due to the nature of its=20 relationships with such entities; e. g. , those entities with respect to whic= h=20 Enron might be considered a fiduciary and which have not consented to their= =20 inclusion and those entities about which Enron has or regularly receives=20 material, non-public information.  In addition, those entities with which= =20 Enron has entered into confidentiality agreements will most likely need to = be=20 excluded, depending on the terms of such agreements. ? Enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20 information regarding Reference Entities on which Products are listed. =20 Pursuant to these procedures, Enron should suspend the listing of quotation= s,=20 and therefore the issuance of new Products, with respect to a Reference=20 Entity, if Enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20 regarding such Entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension= =20 necessary or advisable.  This would include situations in which Enron is=20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a Reference Entity.  I= n=20 addition, the procedures should provide for Reference Entities to be exclud= ed=20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to Enron=01,s possession of information as= =20 well; e. g. , where Enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20 respect to such Entities. =20 ? The procedures should state that Enron may close out an open position for= a=20 Product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests= =20 Enron to do so.  The procedures should also address the pricing of the=20 closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th= at=20 minimizes Enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20 information. =20 ? Enron should provide training to the appropriate personnel, which should= =20 include instructing such personnel not to furnish Product counterparties wi= th=20 any notification or explanation of a Reference Entity being placed on the= =20 restricted list. =20 As noted, we will be assisting you in developing these procedurew, which wi= ll=20 need to be integrated into Enron=01,s existing policies and procedures.  In= =20 addition, as we have advised you in our prior memoranda, there are no=20 procedures that will fully insulate Enron from the potential liabilities=20 arising in connection with its offering of the Product.  However, the=20 implementation of the types of procedures described above should assist
