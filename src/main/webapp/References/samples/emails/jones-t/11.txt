our training.  Also, if you could get some dates for me we'll check them against our schedule.  Would your group organize this lunch or ours?  How many people are we talking about.  Only Global Contract or Global Counterparty too?  Let me know the details so we can start planning. . . I hope Carol will come!  Holly was going to call her. 	"Patti Young" <pyoung@cliverunnells. com> I wanted to let you know that the form of Enron Corp. Guaranty has been agreed to with BNP Paribas and has been sent up to Enron Corp. for signature today.  I will send you a copy of the Guaranty once it is fully executed. I hope we can do more than meet, if possible, let me buy you dinner! 	Matthew Dawson Per my discussions with Leslie Hansen and Dave Forster, please restrict Australian based counterparties from trading US physical power on a going forward basis.  To the best of our knowledge, no Australian based counterparty has been granted a FERC license to trade physical US power.  This situation, of course, can change if a counterparty were to provide us evidence of their FERC licensing. At the request of Kay Young, I am faxing you the four confirmations for the referenced deal.  Please look for them. I've gotten some calls from the business people who want to trade with two counterparties right away.  One is Michigan Consolidated Gas Company, which is on the list for the 19th, and the other is Mobil Oil Corporation Supply & Distribution which is on the list of the 20th.  Can you please make sure the individuals in Global Contracts responsible for these counterparties update them today. Our business people would be most appreciative! Can you email over to me the form of UK Industrial we worked out while I was over there.  Thanks! On the list for 3/20/00, the only counterparty I am responding for is Carthage Energy.  Eventually I will be making the Australian responses, but we are not there yet. On the 3/21/00 list, National Energy was amended, and I had no changes to my previous approvals.  Western Resources is an amended counterparty and I am opening them up for all financial and power. Thanks for the assist!
