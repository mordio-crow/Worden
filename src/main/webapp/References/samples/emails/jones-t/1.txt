Columbia Acts?  I know they are less stringent than the US rules, but I don't know the exact levels. Please take me off your distribution.  I already bought my new car.  Thank youl. 	Larry Joe Hunter I understand from Mark that in order to open up the utilities to trade financial, we will need to amend the GTC's to add some additional reps and provisions.  Do you have a timetable for when we will be able to do that? That signed ETA Amendment came in about a week ago, and the copy has already been sent to Lisa Lees, and the file is closed as far as I'm concerned. 	Karen O'Day@ENRON Below are forms you will need to prepare confirmations which we will discuss later this week.  I would password protect them so no one change change them by mistake. Mercy, Since there are so many new Credit people that we (Legal) do not know, it would be very helpful if you could provide me with a new list of the Credit Team and their phone numbers.  The last list we have is dated 6/5/00.  Thanks! Thanks Mercy! 	Mercy Gil/ENRON@enronXgate Can you please send me only 1 list of Clickpaper counterparties per day.  It gets very confusing for me sometimes to figure out what lists I should be responding to when I get multiple lists.

Regards, Aparna Rajaram ext. 5-4563 Mark Taylor has asked me to prepare an NDA for the referenced counterparty.  Please let  me know if we have any existing NDA's in place.  Thanks. At the request of Kay, I have started sending my requests re: Confidentiality Agreements to her via email so she can print out a record for her files. Did you forget something in your email? Several things are not very clear to me and I need to run them by you. 1.  From your email it appears to me that there would be no legal reason prohibiting your Australian based counterparties from trading all of the products we offer, however, except for financial Australian power, the contracting Enron entity will have to be the party referenced on the particular product.  It appears that the only product Credit has currently opened the Australian based counterparties to trade anyway is Australian financial power. 2.  Will you be approving the Australian based counterparties for trading?
