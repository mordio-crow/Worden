but no, I was ever dissappointed that I was not a high priority for you.  I suppose I'll just keep waiting.

I finally got the other version to work, but only by running it on Ken's computer.  I have some questions regarding the summary sheet, and I plan on spending a significant amount of time with the model this weekend. . . . so yes, let's meet tomorrow if possible.  I'm free anytime except between 9:30 am and noon.  Just name the time and place.  I also need to get familiar with the model used in Chicago for the real time decision making.  Speak to you soon. Mat Tom, Here are the two curve files for this year that I have downloaded.  Thanks for your help. Mat Kristen, I thought Mark had called you, but I guess not.  He said that he can't have Wendy and Amy change their plans, so he can't go on the ski trip.  It was pathetic. . . . I heard, "so, are you guys still planning on coming that weekend? . . . well good. . . . "  He proceeded to talk for at least two hours on the phone, and just mentioned the outcome yesterday.  I pushed him to give me details, but all he said was the cost was a major factor and that Wendy had time off.  I think he was bullshiting and that he never really asked them (I'm such a skeptic).  Anyway, fuck'm.  Any ideas?
