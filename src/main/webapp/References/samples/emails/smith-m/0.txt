Jeanne, Per our conversation, I am requesting a check for the remaining dollar value from the relocation credit card provided to me.  The name as it appears on the card is Matthew Smith.  My new address is:  2345 Bering Dr. , Apt. 514, Houston, TX 77057.  It would be great to have the check by the end of the week. Thanks you. Mat OH MY GOD, THIS IS WAY TOO FUCKING WEIRD! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! I sent you the message below earlier today and had two emails waiting for me this afternoon.  One indicating that I sent it to the wrong address and your email.  I can't believe it!  The worst part about it is that, yes, I am planning a trip to NYC, and I'm going to be there this weekend, which was the point of my email this morning!  HOLY SHIT!  THAT SUCKS!  I can't believe you're not going to be there.  When are you leaving/coming back?  I try to call you, but I don't know if I still have you're numbers (I've been useless since my Palm Pilot crashed).  Anyway, again, this is freaky.

Cheryl, I will be attending the reception on Thursday for the A/A program.  Thanks. Mathew Smith 	 	 Good Morning.   Sorry I didn't call last night. . . I went out and it was late when I got home, and not knowing how late you were going to be out, I decided not to take the chance of waking you.  So did you have a good time?  Who did you go with?  I didn't think you were going out until the weekend - you little party animal.  That means you must have missed Buffy and Angel!  Oh I bet you taped it though, and no I didn't watch them incase you were wondering.  Remind me to tell you about a new project I may get
