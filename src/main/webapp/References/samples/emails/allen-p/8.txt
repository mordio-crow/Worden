I want to speak to Wade myself.  He can call me at work or home. Or if you email me his number I will call him.  I would like Gary to direct Wade on renovation tasks and you can give him work orders for normal maintenance. I will call you tomorrow to discuss items from the office.  Do you need Mary to come in on any more Fridays?  I think I can guess your answer. I might stop by this Friday.

Phillip Lucy, Click on this attachment to see the format to record expenses.  You can keep a log on paper or on the computer.  The computer would be better for sending me updates. What do you think about being open until noon on Saturday.  This might be more convenient for collecting rent and showing open apartments. We can adjust office hours on another day. Phillip Jeff, I will respond to the offer on Monday.  There is a $35 Million expansion adding 250 jobs in Burnet.  I am tempted to hold for $3000/acre.  Owner financing would still work.   Do you have an opinion? Phillip Al, I was glad to hear from you.  I hope we can put the past behind us.  Sounds like you have been busy.  Congratulations on the new baby.  Judging from your email all is well with you.   That's great.  We did have another girl in December, (Evelyn Grace).  Three is it for us.  What's your target?  The other two are doing well.  Soccer, T-ball, and bike riding keeps them busy.  They could use some of Cole's coordination. My fitness program is not as intense as yours right now.  I am just on maintenance.  You will be surprised to hear that Hunter is a fanatical cyclist.  We have been riding to work twice a week for the last few months.  He never misses, rain or shine.  Sometimes we even hit the trails in Memorial Park on Saturdays.   Mountain biking is not as hard as a 50 mile trip on the road.  I would like to dust off my road bike and go for a ride some Saturday. I would like to hear more about your new job.  Maybe we could grab lunch sometime.  Phillip Mary, If we add both balances together the total is $1,140.  I can spread it over 6 or 12 months.  6 month payout would be $190/month.  12 month payout would be $95/month.  Your choice.  I would like it if you could work 5/hrs each Friday for another month or so.  Does $10/hr sound fair?  We can apply it to the loan.
