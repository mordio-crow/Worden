get a starting rb (the 10th best i might add) for a backup WR.  the reason i want engram so bad is b/c i have his qb and i think he will have a pretty good year. by the way engram was picked the 8th round, dillon in the 2nd. so don't give me any of that your boy is being ridiculous - does he really think he will get the 10th best rb for the 30th receiver? oh, because i was going to offer up stephen davis, but never mind . . . What do you want for Fred Taylor? for Kevin Johnson, Wayne Chrebet, and Bill Schroeder? What Do you want for Engram? Hey Mom, The x-rays were negative, and i haven't heard about the review yet. how is everything on your front? love, e Hear anything on Engram? What is your offer on marcus robinson? Muhsin Muhammed and Elvis Grbac for Jeff Garcia, Raymont Harris, and Wayne Chrebet? Gives you starting QB and depth at RB (all 4 of your RBs will likely not play week 1 and maybe 2). Let me know What do you want for Fred Taylor -  do you see he is out for the first 2 weeks? Please take time to answer a new poll on the website! Alright,  I think this is a good deal for you! You get Depth at Receiver and Depth at Running Back. Dillon, Chrebet, Schroeder, and Raymont Harris or Lamar Smith FOR Williams, Hayes, and Robert Smith What do you think? 	Enron Capital Management 	 any counter? 	Enron Capital Management 	 What do you think?  chrebet,dillon How about Raymont, Bill Schroeder and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman? we will make it effective today so that, you can't stockpile players Your running backs suck.  I will give you Raymont Harris and Wayne Chrebet for Freeman. I was thinking that there would be a moratorium on the bidding process for free agents until the start of the season.  If you disagree, let me know. The moratorium will last until noon on Wednesday, August 30th.  You can have no more than 17 players on your roster at any time. since my team sucks so bad, i want to bet you $1000 that i have a better record than you this year i thought we decided that was during the season - up until the season starts it is free. your team is so bad so you are basically saying that you wouldn't take stephen davis for gonzo You cannot pickup players in the playoffs.  That defeats the whole purpose of the playoff system! Patrick Ryder@ENRON 12/06/2000 03:20 PM To: Jason.
