they are successful, (which he thinks TBI will be), then TBI will turn-around and look to spin off the non-strategic systems (like the Piceance Basin assets) to third party purchasers. This conversation with Tom Brown led me to a worst case scenario with regard to our negotiations with Wildhorse. . . . . . . . . . . . . . Wildhorse has been slow-playing negotiations since I first met with them in late May and #4 above may be the reason why.  Now that we've sent the letter recently to Wildhorse requesting (essentially) to clarify their understanding / status of the contracts so we can get to work, my feeling (based on the transaction between KMI & TBI) is that Wildhorse may try to continue stalling until their transaction with TBI is complete, (how much longer will this take? ).  Of course, if the transaction is completed, TBI has already made it clear they would like to sell this system, so even if ENA is interested, will TBI negotiate a gathering deal during this transition period or delay until the system is divested? The point is this. . . . . . I'm anticipating a generic, non-commital response to Crescendo's letter from Wildhorse.  Although I realize there are no time deadlines in the contract, could you suggest anything we can submit in writing to encourage a quick resolution to our contractual issues in the event my above worst case scenario begins to play itself out? I'm off to Grand Junction to meet with Wildhorse.  I'll keep you informed of any developments. Thanks. Dan Chris,  The Amended Firm Gathering Agreements were executed back around July 1.
