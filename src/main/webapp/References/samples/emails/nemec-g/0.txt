Ken,  Please review the attached. Trevor,  I created an amendment to the Energy Services Agreement based on Paul's letter of April 19.  I think that this amendment is a much cleaner way to revised the Schedules to the Agreement.  Please review the amendment and schedules.  I revised the schedules further to make the base line calculations clearer.  If OK, lets fax a copy to Paul for his review before I prepare executables.  Let me know if you have any questions. Note:  We will also need to have a declaration of HPL and Managing Partner of HCC to review and approve this amendment.  Kevin Howard can sign and I have already prepared this document.  I am glad you asked me to lunch today.  I do enjoy spending time with you even though at times it is tough and our conversations are hard right now.  I do Love You so much and have a Vision. Joan,  The contract states that Wildhorse only has to accept gas from Crescendo that the downstream carriers will accept.  Per Brett Frie at Enogex, the Entrada production is 24% Nitrogen.  Until the plant is up and running, this gas will not meet any of the downstream carriers specs.  I am not sure how we get the Nitrogen out of the gas stream without the plant?  The Dakota production was not mentioned in the letter, because I have no facts about the gas quality of this gas.  You had forwarded emails last week indicating the Dan Reineke was to take samples at the wellhead and downstream of Wildhorse's plant.  Once we have these facts we can send a letter concerning the Dakota.  Do you have any info on these samples?

"   I thought the purpose of this letter was to get Wildhorse to take all of our gas right now, not just after the plant is started up.  Is this not so?   I agree with Dan, that  this letter only discusses the Entrada gas, with no mention of the Dakota curtailment, which I think it should. I had just a couple minor changes. . .

However, I wanted to offer the following ideas for discussion with you and the others listed above as to potential inclusion in the Wildhorse letter: A.  Should we request written notification from Wildhorse related to the shut-in status of Entrada production?  Should we request written notification related to the recent curtailment of Dakota production?  [As we've discussed, Enogex never requested anything in writing from Wildhorse, so we
