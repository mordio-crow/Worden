Star Wars:  The Magic of Myth.   It will be on display from March 11 - June 24, 2001 and we're really excited about it!  We know that there are going to be a variety of ways to involve the business units, employees and our external customers, and therefore we are asking you to participate on a steering committee to make sure that we leverage this to Enron's maximum potential.   Your expertise is needed! Our kick-off meeting will be Monday, October 16th at 3 p. m.  in 4C2.  I will explain the exhibit in further detail at that time.  Please let me know if you are able to attend.  Cookies will be served . . .
