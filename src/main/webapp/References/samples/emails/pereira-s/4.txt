 By the way, we just saw Spy Kids for the second time.  If it's playing down there, you ought to take the kids.  Alexia will especially enjoy it. See you soon. Love, Susan Thanks for your help.  It sounds like your girl scout outings are a little more exotic than ours.  Our last event was an overnight campout in one of the girls' backyards.  The girls had a lot of fun.  I was lucky and didn't have to volunteer.  Michael got to be an only child for the night and got all the attention.  He loves it when Kali spends the night away! ! Talk to you soon. Susan Thanks.  Just let me know when you want me to come over. Susan Pereira Jan- Looks good.  I'll finalize with Renato when he gets back in town tomorrow.  We'll email you then. Thanks for all your help. Susan Roy Anne- Will the last brownie meeting be on the afternoon of May 9?  We have early dismissal that day.  The recognitions for the cookie sale may not be available until the evening of the 9th.  I've emailed the coordinator to see if we can get them earlier. Thanks, Susan Julie- Is there any chance that the recognitions will be available prior to May 9?  Our troop is having its last meeting before the summer on the afternoon of May 9.  Let me know if I can help. Thanks, Susan Pereira Just kidding with you.  Hope your hand is getting better.  See you on Monday. Susan Have you been drinking, Kimberly? ?

To congratulate them, in my absence Rain will be collecting money.  Please give her your donatin.  The celeration will take place next week, another e-mail will be sent with details. Thanks K- David- If I want to communicate with the other commission members, am I supposed to funnel it through you?  If so, I want to find out if anyone is interested in setting up a table at the carnival (April 21) to solicit public opinion on P&Z issues.  We could set up next to the tree committtee or share a table.  I'll be at the carnival until about 3 pm; however, I'll be working from 12-2.  Also, we could solicit public opinion outside the clubhouse on election day, May 5.  I could do that anytime before 4 pm.  Anyone else interested? ? ? Thanks, Susan Pereira pereira@houston. rr. com susan. w. pereira@enron. com 713-349-8836 Ruth- I went ahead and scheduled Kali to do the GSWEC camp the first two sessions.  I've only put the deposit down, so I can get that money back if we decide to do the Blue Fox Farm camp instead.  Hopefully, we'll have that info
