at?  The Hotel Colonial Iguacu e Spa looked like the nicer one on the internet.  I imagine the flights will be cheaper booking them there.  Is that right?  Let me know the airline and I'll check here.  I guess we would go on July 4 and return on July 5.  Also, would y'all want to go as well? Thanks for your help. Susan Thanks.  See you on Thursday. Susan Kathy- I got your message.  Kali has been going to the Thursday practices, with the exception of the last three weeks due to rainout, spring break and a going away party for a friend.  She'll be there on this Thursday.  Do you have a uniform for her?  Maybe she would feel part of the team if she gets a shirt and has that for the next game.  I'll try to work on her. Thanks, Susan Pereira David- Is the meeting on for April 2?

Kali and Michael will leave for Brazil with y'all on Wed. the 27th on the evening flight (? ).  Let me know the exact Continental flight number so we can make the reservations.  We'll get the seat assignments coordinated later I guess. Renato and I will take a flight out of Houston on the evening of July 6, arriving Saturday morning.   The four of us will return to Houston on the next Fri. night flight (13th).  I think we've decided not to go to Foz do Iguacu, since we have so little time.  Instead, we'd like to go to Rio for a few days.  Can we all go together and drive.  Maybe you could get hotel reservations there? Let me know what you think.   We're excited about the trip.  The kids can't wait. Susan I would like to have a spot in the new garage. Susan W.
