know: Thanks.  I had a feeling Laura's gift was the bath bag.  As for the $20 donation, I'm glad we got it, because we ended up short on the cash collected for the cookies.  Susan Hi, Elise.  Sorry to bother you, but when Kali was unwrapping her presents last night, there were two without cards or tags (probably lost in transit! ! ).  We narrowed it down to Laura and Sofi.  So that we can get the thank you notes correct, did Laura give Kali  a Skipper doll or a bath set in a blue bag?  Thanks for your help. Susan P. S. - We ended up selling 131 boxes at the booth on Saturday. I would like to cancel my registration for this class. Thanks, Susan Pereira Ernie Rob- From now on, I think Nelson Ferries (w/Enron) will be handling all our short term wellhead purchases.  He may have talked to you already.   His number is 713-853-3061.  Thanks. Susan Pereira My location is EB 3223F.

E-mail it to me or call me at  X58483. Thank you Sara  Solorio Helen- I don't think we will be able to do group lessons during the week, but, just for grins, what is the time of the Tuesday afternoon class?  How many kids are in the class and who is the instructor?  Also, are there any group lessons on the weekends that my daughter Kali might participate in?  Are the classes large? Thanks, Susan Pereira We'll plan to come to the camp. Thanks, Susan Pereira Helen- Since we last emailed, something has come up on Sunday afternoon.  Would it be possible to do the lesson earlier, like 11 am or noon?  Or, Kali has Monday the 19th off and could do a lesson anytime that day. Thanks, Susan Pereira I am not available for any recruiting at this time. \ Susan Pereira Paul LeBeau@ENRON 02/15/2001 02:01 AM To: Jeffrey Donahue/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Mitchell Taylor/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Jean Mrha/NA/Enron@Enron, Joe Gold/LON/ECT@ECT, Richard Lydecker/Corp/Enron@Enron, Davis Maxey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark Bernstein/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Crews/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Kenneth Wang/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Greg Woulfe/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Richard Park/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Dave Samuels/HOU/ECT@ECT, Susan W Pereira/HOU/ECT@ECT, Tom Huntington/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Guido Caranti/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Seth Hurwitz/Corp/Enron@Enron, Frank Karbarz/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gaurav Babbar/HOU/ECT@ECT, LaRence Snowden/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, Farzad Farhangnia/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jay Epstein/HOU/ECT@ECT, Patrick Meyers/HOU/AZURIX@AZURIX, Meera Natarajan/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, George N Gilbert/HOU/ECT@ECT, Yvan Chaxel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mark Bernstein/HOU/ECT@ECT, christie_Patrick@enron. com, cindy. derecskey@enron. com, Michael B Rosen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Laura Luce/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Judy Nyegaard/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject:
