 I'm so overwhelmed at the goodness of God.  Know ye not that it's the goodness of God that leads a man to repent.  I feel like I just got a new boyfriend that I want to spend all my time with.  Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! Ok-Ok.  I just wanted to share a scripture with you girls.  Hebrews 4:12 - For the word of God is quick, and powerful, and sharper than any twoedged sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit, and of the joints and marrow, and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. I'm so excited and encouraged to continue in this race.  I'm so thankful that God is teaching me through you and His Word that this race is not given to the swift, neither to strong but to the one that endures to the end.  Keep pressing my sisters!
