meeting.  Grace, Pastor, Kevin, Carolyn, Mother Jackson and I were there. Not a whole lot of decisions were made;  mostly we just gave Grace an update on what we discussed last Wednesday.  "DON'T QUOTE ME" Mass mailing to all churches is our area as well as some selected churches outside our area  such as Windsor Village, Mount Vernon, St. Agnes, Abundant Life, Good Hope, Lakewood and Memorial. Target date: Nov. 15th and Dec. 1 cut off Curtis spoke to Shaun McLemore yesterday? .  He said something about having nice and lengthy conversation with him regarding some CD.

I'll see you tonight at choir rehearsal. dd HAVE YOU GUYS READ THIS STORY BEFORE AND WHAT DO YOU THINK? >  26 Guards > > > > Here's a message that will bring chills.
