million gross margin.  Another one year deal for 8000/day, also to the California border, will give us over $1 million gross margin.  Two other examples for 11 months each will generate an additional combined $1.5 million.  Hopefully this will justify our need for this system.  Let me know if you need anything else. Kim Kouri 10/27/2000 08:19 AM To: Michelle Lokay/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc:  Subject: TW Deal Profitability/Analysis Michelle, I am trying to get some quantification of actual benefits (in terms of $'s saved or loss avoided) of your use of the model.  Could you give me some feedback before Tuesday, as Phil Lowry is asking about use and actual benefits of this model. Thanks Kim FYI. . . I will be taking Vacation this afternoon.  Thanks. Count me in for either Monday or Tuesday.  Thanks!

There is a slide about our new or proposed supply interconnects.  Please send me an email with the capacity/volume and projected in-service (or if it's already in-service) for your project.  If I have the wrong people, please let me know. Please send this to me this afternoon by 4:30.  Thank you! ! NGPL Kevin CIG Christine Duke Bob EOG Michelle (&/or Bob? ) In an effort to bring incremental revenue for our pipeline, I researched outstanding invoices generated from facility interconnects, etc.  Transwestern currently has no outstanding dollars to collect.  However, there appears to be $600,000 that can be collected on Northern Natural in addition to $250,000 that was written off.  Attached are the spreadsheets from Accounts Receivable. Do you know  about the variable costs?  I don't think any of the Park and Rides have ever been analyzed in Deal Profitability? ! ? ! Key bullets for 2000 accomplishments and 2001 goals: Executed firm transport contract with Oneok at maximum rate for California deliveries.  Contract also includes provision for Marketing Fee if contract is ever released above max rate. Completed new interconnect with EOG for additional 15,000/day.  Potential opportunity for future transport agreement. Settled dispute
