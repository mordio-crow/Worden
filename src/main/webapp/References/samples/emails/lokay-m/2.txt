How's your job - is it you? How's Meghan? (sp right? )  Bring her to Poli's party . . . . I hope you come. Write me and let me know how you're doing when you can.  Did you buy a house? I really miss talking to you (and lunch! ).   All my lunch partners are gone. Linda's wedding is coming along.  The wedding is planned for Sept. 9 - be here before you know it. I hate it that I didn't get to say bye to you - you were always a pleasure to talk to you - always "up" - which is good! BYE - write when you can.
