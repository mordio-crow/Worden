of 1/15-1/19:  Are you absolutely positive about these numbers? With all the problems in CA how could El Paso not be flowing more at Topock? I know we are taking up part of the space but it seems like they should be full to SoCal as well. Please reconfirm with other sources. 	 	 Just wanted you to know. . . Please set up the following people with "trader" status under Transwestern Pipeline Company.  We will be using Enron On Line to trade pipeline capacity.  Kevin Hyatt (administrator), Michelle Lokay, Lorraine Lindberg, Jeff Fawcett, and TK Lohman will all need this access.  My network user ID is "mlokay" and each trader will respond with their own user ID.  Thanks.

He would like us to continue with drawings, engineering, etc. using his prepayment.  They have the list of equipment for ordering, but are waiting until the results of the well (hopefully by next week).  They also understand that some of the items could have long lead times.  We are all hoping this will be as successful as EOG's interconnect. 	 	 What do you think?
