The minimum requirement to keep ROFR in a contract extension is with maximum rate for at least 1 year.  Cathy Bulf will let TW know by Monday, and in writing, if they would like to exercise. Would love to attend, but I will be out on vacation.  Can I have a copy of any notes that are taken?

Anyway, we would like to set-up a two hour meeting for Thursday, August 3rd to discuss the variables for modeling westward throughput on TW (to forecast fuel).  This will be a brainstorming session to discuss the various impacts on the level of throughput, such as, hydro levels, weather, prices, seasonality, etc.  Please let me know if morning or afternoon on the 3rd is good for you.
