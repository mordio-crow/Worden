Capacity is 10000 to Needles and 10000 to Topock, both expiring end of Jan 2001.  Her bids are through Oct 2001 at .16 plus fuel or through Mar 2002 at current rate of .131 plus fuel.  What is our strategy?  The spreads have tightened since last week.  She has to be notified by ASAP, so she can exercise her ROFR. 	 	 Count me in, if still available.  Thanks!
