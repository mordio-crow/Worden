Unfortunately, Harry's on vacation.  I'll call in just as soon as I get done with Delainey.  Also, I was on a call with Eric yesterday, during which I went over the S. D. legislation, so he should be fairly up to speed.  I'll get on just as soon as I can. Best, Jeff 	Jennifer Rudolph@EES if i try to think about one more thing, my head will explode.
