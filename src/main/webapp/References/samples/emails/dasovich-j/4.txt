it got. Putting the PX inside the ISO will only infect the wound that's already been inflicted. The real answer is. . . . (we've developed these points already). This is quick and dirty and can be made much more punchy and articulate, but wanted to get the notion out there given our time constraints. Best, Jeff don't sell just yet. FYI.  Bill Gang of EES Federal Solutions has been working actively with the Air Force in California.  I've participated in weekly calls with them in the effort to get them energized about DA.  Turns out they're precluded by law from lobbying.  But they seem to have other ways of being influential.  I've put Scott Govenar in contact with them and he's keeping them in the DA Coalition loop.  Bill/Scott is this guy familiar to you?  Bill any suggestions on how we might best target them in our efforts to get groups energized?  Bill:  Perhaps you could phone Janel Guerrero directly to discuss?  Her number is:  713.853.9104 (is that right Janel)?

I would like to loop him into our non-business target with a letter from Ken.  Do you also see them having a role in the Direct Access Coaltion?  I'll let you work that end.

He is already communicating with Scott Governor -- I'll forward that email next. Sue Mara Enron Corp. Tel: (415) 782-7802 Fax:(415) 782-7854 This is great info and very helpful.  Thanks a million.  I'll likely be getting back to you. Best, Jeff 	James D Foster@EES Greetings: Sorry to bother you with this, but please see notes below.  I need to find out who I can contact to get information on our noncore accounts.  I'm assuming that you might know whom that would be.  Thanks a million. Hope all's well. Best, Jeff I'm assuming that since it's the middle of March, that it's only fair that he should get paid for services rendered in January, but maybe I'm missing something. 	Susan J Mara Thanks very much for your help. Best, Jeff Great points.  Teece---and the lion's share of the folks on
