Gavin I've RSVP'd for you. I agree that we should not be opposing rate caps for small customers and schools, but I think we should be pounding on the fact that market participants have been putting offers in front of sdge and that allowing the market to provide this solution is superior to legislated caps that require the creation of huge deferrals (and more problems in the future). Can we make that argument work?

Wood's two-day hearing on Wholesale Markets, which concluded today (8/24) in San Diego.  Three Commissioner's were present (Wood, Lynch and Neeper) with Duque and Bilas participating by phone.  Administrative Law Judge Wetzel was present and a transcript was taken.  The quasi-legislative hearing was the beginning of a record developed for the investigation into the workings of wholesale/retail markets.  This session focused on Wholesale markets.  There will be subsequent sessions on retail issues, market structure and other related issues in the future.  My conclusion from this session is that Wood is looking for support for increasing regulatory intervention in the market. Dan Larcamp, Director of the Office of markets, Tariffs and Rates, FERC, was present.  He relayed FERC's concern of this matter and a desire to hold hearings in San Diego.  He also relayed that Hoecker held a press conference announcing the opening of a 206 investigative proceeding into the operation of the wholesale markets in California, which carried with it refund authority. The format of the hearing was to respond to pre-filed questions developed by Wood/Lynch.  Each member of the panel would respond to the questions and any questions posed by the Commissioners, the Judge or the CPUC Attorney.  No questions were posed by members of the audience.  Yesterday's panel of academics were comprised of: 1.  Dr. Timothy Duane-UC Berkley 2.  Dr. William Hogan-Harvard 3.  Dr. Frank Wolak-Stanford (ISO Market Surveillance Committee) 4.  David Marcus-Energy Consultant for the Coaltion of Utility Employees 5.  Dr. Gene Coyle 6.  Dr. Jean-Michel Glachant, Universite Paris I Pantheon Sorbonne The panel was asked to speak as individuals and not on behalf of any institutions they may represent.  While the purpose of the panel seemed to be to determine that market power was being exercised and that prices were too high and therefore not just and reasonable, the panelist stopped short of blaming generators and market participants in behaving illegally.  The concensus generally was that market power did exist at various times, but the mere existence did not constitute bad behavior.  None, with the exception of Dr. Wolak who is in the process of doing a
