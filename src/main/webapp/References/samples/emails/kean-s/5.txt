San Diego the flexibility to accept one or more of them.  This is sounder than running huge deferrals (deficits) to be later recovered from consumers. Rate relief should be accompanied by real reform.  Rate caps have bad long term consequences: they cause shortages.  Combining short-medium term rate relief with expedited siting of new facilities will address the near term problem while laying the proper groundwork for a long term solution.

The information provided is subject to change because of constant flux. However it is important for us to provide this information for feedback and to caution as to new regulations that may affect some deals in the making . Governor Davis, Assembly Women Susan Davis, and Senator Alpert had a press conference. They will introduce a rate/bill stabilization plan for SDG&E and an expediting siting bill. There is no language as of yet. Although there is no specific language, the following elements may be included: The stabilization plan will be applicable to residential and probably commercial customers in SDG&E The bill cap may be set at $68 for residential. The cap will be in place until the end of 2002 There will be language on expediting siting for generation plants  Sam Wehn and Sandra McCubbin have been talking with the CEC executive director and several legislators about the siting portion of the bill. Any comments as to the bill cap proposal? Skilling In the second paragraph we should delete the "partnership" statement.  I think it's more effective to refer to the New Power Company's risk management capabilities (as provided by Enron, if necessary).  That's the basis for the ability to guarantee savings (not economies of scale).  I am also concerned that the current statement implies that Enron is taking the risk on the commodity price guarantees.
