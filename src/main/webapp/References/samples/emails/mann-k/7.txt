last night.  Will you be picking up emails in the next day or so?  I can forward you what I've done for your review. We need to get a Enron/BP dialogue going concerning the lease with the City of Rocky Mount.  When do you want to discuss this (or have us discuss it with the right B & P person)? Thanks, Kay "Nancy Wodka" <nwodka@bracepatt. com> on 09/19/2000 03:29:28 PM To: <Kay. Mann@enron. com> cc:  Subject: Re: VEPCO I forgot to reply to this.  Just let me know when you want to discuss it.  I'll jot down some thoughts on risk issues in the meantime.  >>> <Kay. Mann@enron. com> 09/15/00 02:30PM >>> Here at Enron the lawyers generate risk memos in connection with transactions, summarizing the more important legal risks in a deal.  I've been taking notes along the way, but I will be asking you for your thoughts here shortly.  A discussion will be all I'm looking for at this time. Thanks, Kay Speaking of options. . . . I don't think I saw that happen.  Kathleen Carnahan 09/19/2000 04:50 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:  Subject: Re: Someone at the San Antonio Law Conf.  Like down by the swimming pool with Geneva Holland?  He was sooo tanked I had Carlos go to take him to his room (but some nice female helped him instead). To: Kathleen Carnahan/NA/Enron@Enron cc:  Subject: Re: Someone at the San Antonio Law Conf.  On which day?  I don't recall being any worse than anyone else. Kathleen Carnahan 09/19/2000 04:12 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc: Carlos Sole/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Someone at the San Antonio Law Conf. Kay, Would you say that Travis McCullough was just a tad tipsy (to the point of being intoxicated) at the Law Conference?  Carlos does not believe me. Kathleen I need to set up a conference call with the outside lawyer who will be drafting the lease (and other docs).  Who would like to participate in the call? How about Thursday am? Thanks, Kay viola Thank you for your response.  It is always refreshing to get good news!

The answer is yes.  Because the parties (within broad parameters) can make just about whatever law they like so long as it doesn't violate public policy, etc. , Virginia freely allows limitation of liability clauses.  Of course, in the case of fraud or material misrepresentation in inducement, etc. , no court would honor the clause, but that circumstance does not apply to us. Please let me know if you need anything further. David D. David Parr, Jr. , Esq. Bracewell & Patterson, L. L. P. 2000 K Street NW, Suite 500 Washington, D.
