One thing I noticed immediately is on Exhibit A, the heat rate of 10,600 is LHV not HHV.  H I need to provide the NCPUC a copy of the incorporation documents as soon as I can. How long will it take?

I believe we file a Cert of Correction.  CT Corp will confirm this afternoon. The only other documents I have in my file which will need to be replaced are the LLC agmt and the officer election consent. I will proceed expeditously and let you know when complete. Matt A.

His questions were: ownership of LLC (I'm getting the documents) and status of PPA. Kay For your information. Please call me with any comments. Thanks, Kay Yikes.  I think I'd still rather be a woman, although now I can't remember why I feel that way. Got anything?  Should have been signed this year. Thanks, Kay I think the LLC agreement would be a big help.  Thanks! Matt Maxwell on 09/20/2000 04:04:24 PM To: Kay Mann/Corp/Enron@Enron cc:  Subject: Re: Edgecombe LLC  The certificate of formation will not change.  The certified  Certificate of Correction will be attached to it.  The original Certificate will never be changed.  I asked this exact question this afternoon. The Certificate of Correction will be filed with Delaware tomorrow and we can expedite an original to be delivered to us on Friday.  I am running out the door.  Leave me any instructions re additional needs/questions/problems.  My cell number is 713-305-9013 and home is 936-271-4554 if you need anything else today. Matt A. Maxwell Enron North America Corp.
