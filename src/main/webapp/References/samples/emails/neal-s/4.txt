the growth of our markets here in Europe. We trust it won't be too long before we see similarly impressive results from our side of the pond. Best regards Andy please add to my schedule. The guy in B. A. that we booked our hunt with is Emilio Paris (phone # 011 541 14 812 2154).  We hunted near a small town called Rio Tercero about  45 minutes outside of Cordoba.  We stayed at the Los Alamos Lodge.  Our guide's name was Sergio Abrile.  We paid $750 for 3 days of hunting, 2 nights lodging, meals, hunting license, etc.  We paid $9.00/box for shells.  We aleady had our guns,  however they had very nice, new Beretta 12/20 ga. shotguns for rent for $25/day.  We hunted April 30-May 2 which is the end of fall and we slayed the birds.  I think the only time to avoid is during the heart of winter July-August due to cold/wet conditions.  The flight from Buenos Aires to Corboda cost about $200 and takes about an hour. You might call Emilio just to compare prices, etc.  I think he is affiliated with a US outfitter called Gage/4 Seasons.  I hope this info is helpful.  Don't hesitate to call if have nay questions.

He is going to get me the names of some people he hunted with to compare prices, accommodations etc.  A few things he wanted us to check on; 1) BA is a hell of a long way to travel - is the flight bus. class? 2) What time of year are you planning on going - there are better times. Scott was thinking they hunted in May (he is going to check) and had as much shooting (and then some) as he needed. 3) Accommodations in BA and where you hunt.  Again he is going to verify and get some phone numbers but you want to stay close to where you are hunting (not like Mexico) and there are some very nice places - he is thinking he stayed at the Gauge Four Seasons. I will get back to you with more details as I have them. Thanks, Lee - 713-624-9065 (lhanse@br-inc. com) please forward to everyone on the East Desk. thanks, scott I really don't have a clue.
