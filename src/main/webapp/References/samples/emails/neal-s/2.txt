Both are from LSU and start this summer as Associates.  Both have expressed their strong desire to have their first rotation in Trading and I think they would do a great job for us.   If you concur, please make a note to place them in Trading for their first rotation .  I have attached both resumes for your reference. thanks, Scott - new leo's resume. doc - resume1. doc Also, send me a copy of your resume.  thanks. All is well here.   It sounds like you are very busy.  I glad you are taking the options course - it will really benefit you.  Also,  Andrea Richards is the person I contacted with the Associate program to request that your first rotation be in the Trading group - so we should be in good shape on that front.  Her phone number is 713 853 6499 for your future reference.  Thanks for the email, I look forward to seeing you this summer. Scott Geynille, I am out of the office
