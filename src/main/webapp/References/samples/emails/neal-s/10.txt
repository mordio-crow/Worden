Corina, Are the times the same for the Super Saturday on Nov.4? I enjoyed visiting with you as well.  I was very impressed with the students that I interviewed.  You guys are certainly doing a great job educating.  I had the pleasure of visiting with Milagros and was very impressed with her and I agree with your comments. Some of the students were interested in additional reading that I thought might be helpful to them.  2 books that I think are very good  are 1) Option Volatility and Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  This is textbook type reading that is the best book on options that I know.  2) Reminisences of A Stock Operator by  Edwin Lefevre.  This is the best book on trading that I have read (I am actually currently reading it for the fifith of sixth time).  It is an easy read and is the real lfe story of a trader in the early 1900's.  A must read for anyone who has interest in markets and trading. Sincerely, Scott Neal fyi we have 2 weeks to check this out without cost.  maybe we can get additional ideas about how we incorporate capacity trading into EOL. I meant 2001.
