The Wellhead Group is responsible for everything up to the mainline/pool including scheduling, nominations, operational swing etc.  The East desk would have a deal with the Wellheasd Group for a firm daily quantity of gas at the mainline or pool. 	Enron North America Corp. 	 Jennifer Milligan will be contacting regarding the intern program.  She will probably want a resume from you. Also,  she will want to know what area(s) (eg. accounting, marketing, research, etc. )  you have interest in working. Please keep me up to date once she contacts you. Sincerely, Scott Rolo and I worked together in BA.  Rolo did a great job for us, focusing mostly on gas but he did do some work on power as well.  He is very bright and has a great work ethic.  He has gained a fair amount of commercial experience (including "trading" natural gas) in Argentina. I would recommend him highly. yes i want to contribute, and thank you for doing this.
