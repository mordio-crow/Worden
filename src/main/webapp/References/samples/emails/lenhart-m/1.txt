This notice would not allow cycle 4 gas to flow. we need to pass on penalties to counterparties who cut us on gas day of may 11.  many counterparties are swinging on eol deals, so  going foward we are going to rank those counterparties to take the cuts.  as far as this deal goes, the problems incurred were due to logistical issues.  we did rerank wild goose for cycle 4, but pg&e did not allow for renoms on this cycle. did you call for me at work today? did you call me today at work how was your wedding on saturday?  i will be in town fri afternoon.  tell max and  i  will see you guys either fri or sat.  i can't remember if i sent these to you guys or not >"You Were an Accident!
