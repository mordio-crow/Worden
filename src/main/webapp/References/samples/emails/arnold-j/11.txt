they are.   there is a chance i've seen them at satellite i guess. my, you are nosey.  i have a little date tonight.  wanna come along? lumber Deathly afraid doesn't even come close to describing it.  Busy tonight.  How bout tomorrow? Certainly encourage CSFP to transact all volumes with us.  If they shop the deal, everyone will front-run the volumes and they won't get a good price on the deal.  Financial deals settle 5 days after the index has been published.  Physical deals settle much later.   My understanding is this is a financial deal. 	 	 not me don't forget you owe me dinner. . . duke8duke Ina Rangel 10/24/2000 03:16 PM To: John Arnold/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Maggi/Corp/Enron@Enron, Larry May/Corp/Enron@Enron, Jay Reitmeyer/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kenneth Shulklapper/HOU/ECT@ECT, Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT@ECT, Paul T Lucci/NA/Enron@Enron, Tori Kuykendall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Randall L Gay/HOU/ECT@ECT, Frank Ermis/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steven P South/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jane M Tholt/HOU/ECT@ECT, Monique Sanchez/HOU/ECT@ECT, Keith Holst/HOU/ECT@ect, Phillip K Allen/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mike Grigsby/HOU/ECT@ECT cc:  Subject: Login ID's needed The Enron Messaging System is going to be implemented soon and I have been asked to collect everyone's login ID.

Please advise. i heard he's interviewing to be Shankman's right hand man Jennifer Burns Andy: I tried to open EOL at 4 on Sunday, but we had systems problems that delayed the opening until 6:05.  This is the third time in four or five sessions when EOL had problems on Sunday.  Anything you can do to improve reliability would be appreciated. John Adam: Hope your interview goes well.
