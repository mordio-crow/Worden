Carrington (E-mail)" <kegrrin@uswest. com> cc:  Subject: Site Location Advisory Service I am pleased to inform you that one of Canada's leading business service providers, Grant Thornton LLP, is now offering US firms a full Site Location Advisory Service. With over forty offices across Canada, Grant Thornton LLP knows Canada.  We are finding that more and more US corporations are looking north as they are faced with fewer satisfactory location alternatives in which to expand. Canada, with its relatively large and well trained work force, not to mention lower operating costs, is increasingly being considered by companies such as yours. Grant Thornton LLP would be pleased to discuss this service with you.  It is a full service that includes, on your behalf, real estate sourcing, labor force analysis and verification, tax analysis and comparison, and incentive negotiations. Should you be considering expanding your operations and interested in discussing our service, please give us a call.  More and more United States firms, from call centers to manufacturers are locating in Canada to serve both their US and Canadian customers. Based in Moncton, New Brunswick Canada, I can be reached at: Telephone     (506) 857-0100 Cell Phone    (506) 381-1450 E-Mail           mmacbride@grantthornton. ca Michael S.
