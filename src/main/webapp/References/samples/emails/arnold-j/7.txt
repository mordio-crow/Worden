any risk premium built in is h/j now.   it was trading equivalent of 180 on access, down 40+ from this morning.  certainly if we are entering a period of bearish to neutral trade, h/j will get whacked.  certainly understand the arguments for h/j.  if h settles $20, that spread is probably worth $10.  H 20 call was trading for 55 on monday.  today it was 10/17.  the market's view of probability of h going crazy has certainly changed in past 48 hours and that has to be reflected in h/j. and they say it was purely coincidental the announcement came today. 6 is fine.  remember when you said there is a reason they call them bear spreads? bring up a chart of f/g or g/h.   f/g is tighter now than anytime since march 99 when ff1 was worth 2.50 amazing remember i bought rams at 3.50 100 perkins, 100 tony do you know where anything is trading (mids)? let's go check out that new wine storage place this weekend. come by whenever yep absolutely agree.  the thought is always, even if cash is piece of shit today. . . wait until the future.  here's my question: what is the environment whereby f/g is worth $.50.   is there a market scenario where this happens? Catherine: Sorry it's been so long since I could respond.  With the craziness here I am way behind on everything. #1. 3 years #2.  volume way down on exchange recently with recent volatility.  volume probably averaging 25000 these days.  EOL volume averaging around 14000.   Very high percent of market.   Current market conditions shows why our transactional model of being one side of every trade is superior.  #3.  good liquidity first 3 years.  okay liquidity years 4-6. #4.  calendar 2004-2008 maybe 1 trade a day.  70% chance Enron is one side.  calendar 2009-2013  very rare that it trades. Catherine Pernot@ENRON a couple more thoughts.  certainly losing lots of indutrial demand both to switching and slowdown in economy.  Big 3 automakers all temporarily closing plants for instance.  switching is significant and has led to cash in the gulf expiring weak everyday.  gas daily spread to prompt trading at $1. . . . need some very cold weather to justify that.  this seems to be the test of the next 3-5 days.   Will the switching/loss of demand/storage management keep cash futures spread at reasonable levels or will it blow to $5+. Not too many years ago we had a $50 print on the Hub.  unless we get some crazy prints, you have to question the steep backwardation in the market.  funny watching the flies in the front.  Bot large chunk of g/h/j at $.50 friday morning.  probably worth 1.30 now.  crazy.  people have seen each front spread be weak since forever and are already starting to eye up g/h.  what's the thoughts on distillates. . .  is it tight enough such that gas switching is the marginal mmbtu of demand and pulls it up
