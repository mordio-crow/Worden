on the board meeting. Walt is looking at possibly scheduling the Comp Committee for the day before, but will confirm his plans on Thursday and will notify you if that changes. I am telling you all of this to advise you that if any of the remaining board members, being the two of you, Dan Whitty and Ted Gaylord, are not available, we will not be able to have the board meeting.   Walt recommends we go forward with the date as scheduled, unless either of you is aware that one of the four will not be available, or you would rather move the date. Please let me know your thoughts on this.  Thanks. Molly Sample VP & General Counsel EOTT Energy Corp. 713-993-5027 fax 713-402-2806 Glad you could make the trip. The game was awesome.  Our tickets were directly behind homeplate.  Debbie said she could see me on every pitch and knew that I left the bootom half of the 8th inning.  She said I never picked my nose once on camera.  Pretty good, huh. Have a good day.  Talk with you later.  By the way, your car is done.  They had no problem removing the oil filter at all.  They only had to wriggle it a little bit. Love, Daddy Short and to the point.  No changes Karen_Denne%ENRON@eott. com on 04/25/2001 11:04:43 AM To: Kenneth_Lay%ENRON@EOTT. COM, Jeff_Skilling%ENRON@EOTT. COM, Rex_Rogers%EnronXGate@EOTT.

I was like "Look it's Dad! ! !  Cool! ! ! ! "  Unfortunately there was no one here to tell that to but it's ok.  I'm glad you had fun.  I ordered flowers last night for Mom for Mother's Day and for DK for her b-day.  I hope that's ok.
