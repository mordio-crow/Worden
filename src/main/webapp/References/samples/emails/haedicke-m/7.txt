Should we expect many objections to our new policy?  Don't get many objections in the US.

I think it is a good policy, although I am still not as convinced as Sami is that the courts in Brazil will so cavalierly disregard international arbitration provisions. Nevertheless, I think it was necessary to change our policy from a commercial perspective; we were getting too much resistance to foreign arbitration.  Now the question is, do we go the next step and see if Jim will approve submitting to the jurisdiction of some courts in Brazil which are generally reliable and free of corruption (e. g. , Sao Paulo and Rio) if the counterparty rejects arbitration, and the largest sum of money that would ever be in dispute would be less than $500,000?  I think we will face that soon, so we may as well raise it now. Please get this to Mark Frevert.  Mark I think Avista should be primary.  I don't know Kangqi.
