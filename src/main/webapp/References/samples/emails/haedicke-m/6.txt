Schwartzenburg@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT I am only aware of the Edison Institute effort which is a physical power contract.  I think he was probably mistaken.  Mark Yes. 	Theresa Zucha@ENRON John: Keep me posted on this matter.  Thanks.

EPE -- Fine FYI, I received verbal notice today that EPE has been fined in the amount of R$2.2 million (approx US$1.1 million) for failure to comply with its IPP license -- specifically, the failure to dispatch at 450 MW per the instructions of the ONS.  Aneel previously had delivered a notice of noncompliance to EPE and our response was delivered to Aneel on Friday, so the fine probably crossed our response in the mail.  This is another salvo in the ongoing dispute as to whether our PPA, which pre-dates the new regulatory scheme, is to be treated as an exception or whether it needs to be completely renegotiated in order to be able to comply with the current regs.  In any event, it is not good news.  I will keep you posted as I get more details. Regards, John J: please put this on my calender tomorrow.  Mark Yes. 	Mary Cunningham <MCUNNINGHAM@isda. org> Please send out the attached memo that Julia prepared.  Mark Go State! 	John Viverito@ENRON I will pass on it.  Thanks.  Mark 	Louise Kitchen call janette.  Mark 	Matt Maxwell@ENRON Sorry.  My schedule does not permit that change.

Any chance we could have the ESA QLR in San Antonio either Weds. before dinner or before departing from SA on Friday? ? My particular concern is that the large majority of Enron's derivatives business is in North America.  We are growing rapidly in derivatives in Europe, but still quite small.  In terms of derivatives, we are not a factor on other continents.  That is different than major equity, currency or interest rate traders. Mark This is way too much of a commercial!  Two thirds of it speaks only to Kiodex.  Tell him that at least one-half should not be a commercial.  He said he was going to discuss new commodities and slant his presentation torward new commodities.  He needs to do more.
