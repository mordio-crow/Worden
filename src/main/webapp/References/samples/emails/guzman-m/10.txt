I emailed once and called twice in the past week and a half  and haven't heard back from you? Bill I have a freind that just graduated from Oregon State with a business degree i think his emphasis was MIS and finance.  He is a pretty bright kid and wants to pursue a carrer in finance.   I actually talked to him about it at some length about Enron on New Years Day and he seemed very interested.  .  He is a friend of mine from my fraternity and a really good guy who I think would fit in well here if given the opportunity.  I dont know about your feelings on hiring guys right out of college.  I know we had done so in the past but I wasn't really sure about your feelings on that.  Let me know. Dave, I am planning on driving up after I get off work on Saturday morning and should be up in Seattle by about 10:30 or so.  I will probably just go to Jorge's and crash out until you arrive.  Have you guys made any plans for Saturday night?  I talked to Donald, he wasn't aware that you were even coming but he said he would like to do something with all of us.  We actually talked about maybe going skiing on sunday I don't know if you would be intereseted in doing  that.  Ryan, I had already purchased tickets to go to LA and then Las Vegas for that 6 day break i have at the end of the month, so I won't be able to work the night of the 26th hey mark, how about them beavs! ! !     I suppose that surpassed even your expectations.     It was definitely fun to watch them wax ND. Karen and I spent New Years in Palm Desert with a few friends that have a home right on the golf course.   I played a round, but did not shoot as well as I did when I played with you.   Shot a 104. . . . . but was still pleased and had fun. As I told you last week, I will be going to Seattle for business and will be staying with Jorge on Saturday and Sunday nights.   I arrive at Seatac at 1pm on Saturday.      Just wondering if you decided to drive up for the weekend also.       Let me know either way.     If not, then we'll catch you in a couple months. love ya, dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may
