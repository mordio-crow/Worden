 $4,166 I'll go ahead and pay the Mervyns and Macy's bill as soon as I receive your check and since I just got their statements.   I'd like to avoid paying them 18% interest as long as you have the cash.     I have not received a bill from the funeral home, nor have I paid them anything.   I can't remember if you gave them my address or your mom's. FYI,  I've received two voice mails from bill collectors regarding Cito's old Broadway credit card (I think they are now Bloomingdale's).     I have not replied to their voice mails and do not know how they received my phone number.   But I'll ignore them for now since they are trying to hunt down Salvador Guzman, who died 18 years ago anyway.     They will probably give up trying to collect, but just thought I'd let you know about that pending liability.    Do you know how much Bill owed them? In case you don't have my address, it is 7971 Southwind Circle HB   92648 see ya, Dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

Hey a few of us are going to grab some drinks after work wanna come? Jesse told me to email you this.  It is the Cal ISO private web site https://iso_si/iso/ mark I talked to Jorge last night and we thought we'd just hang out at his place or see a movie on Saturday night.     Steve's family is coming over on Sunday for dinner and so is Donald. that's all I know.     I'm not sure about skiiing.     Jorge and Cherie have been snow shoeing lately and that might be fun since it includes them in the activity and I have never done that.   Donald also snow shoes.    We can decide Saturday, but I'm definitely up for an activity. see ya, dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
