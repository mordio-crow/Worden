at 5am this morning! can i read this at work dude? REAALLY? ? I see how it is.  Smell a free dinner and all of a sudden ya wanna hang out Yeah tell me about it.  So the reason I called to see if you wanted to do something last week was because I got a settlement on my some of my dads insurance shit and I wanted to go out to a nice dinner.  I thought it would be a nice opportunity for us to hang out and catch up.  I hope you don't still think that I didn't want to see you that night because you are dating dave, I just had to run some errands right when you called back. Never mind.  So anyway, I am totally worked right now.  I went to the Blazer game with my friend Kate and we ended up going out afterward.  i ended up staying out until 2am and I had to be in to work at 5:30.  So basically my day is totally sucking.  How are you doing? ya don't say? Mark I can wait until Wednesday, then payoff the Mervyns and Macy's accounts. see ya, dave Mark.
