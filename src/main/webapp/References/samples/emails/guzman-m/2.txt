BOYS ! ! .      Didn't they just kick ass! They are peaking at just the right time.     The Dodgers are in first place and the Kings have gone beyond everyone's expectations.   Life is good in Southern California. On the down side,  Ramon got admitted into the hospital over the weekend. It started out as a  problem with very low blood sugar but then escalated into a weak heart problem with very shallow breathing.   They have him on a respirator and plan to wean him off of that this morning.   Cita is all stressed out but thank god that one of her neighbors is spending the night with her.      We're getting an update today on some tests performed on Ramon, so we'll know alot more. Cita is doing fairly well.    I took her for a four hour heart exam last week and it revealed that her last heart attack caused some arterial damage.    The doctor said that if she was younger, he would perform angioplasty.    In any case, her spirits are remarkably high and is still mentally sharp. On another matter,  I got a call last Friday from Ford Motor Credit regarding your account.    They left a number and asked if you could call them because "they have not been able to reach you".     The number they left was 877-873-0085.      Apparently, you left me as a reference on the application. Hope you are doing ok and am looking forward to seeing you in June! love ya, Dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.

I do have your goggles however i don't thin that i have your ski pants.  You asked me about this last spring but, I couldn't find the pants then either. Not much here I have to work Saturday and Sunday dayshifts, which kind of sucks however, I am usually ok to go out until like 10-11 on nights like that as Saturdays are not too busy.  Is Bailey 3 now? Just bored and writting to say hi.  What do you have going on this weekend? I don't think threats of violence are appropriate in the workplace. I am considering filing a complaint.  I don't know.  If you are talking about your TV, I won't
