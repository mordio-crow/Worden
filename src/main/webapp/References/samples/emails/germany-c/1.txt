sure enough the nom isn't out there yet. I can get help nominating it from PNG to get it through CES' pool but I want to make sure that's what we need to do.  Just give me the word and I will call Sampson to get it done, but I will make it clear to him that this is the last month he'll need to talk to me about it.  Thank you very much for the clarifications! Kara D. aka the lone ranger at CES Thank you for sending my drill book.  I believe I have the key your are looking for.  I also have a "Dog Care" book that fell out of Daisy's folder when I got her out of "jail".  I will have these items delivered to you as soon as possible.
