have the following transport contracts on CNG for July. k#  MDQ  Comment 5A2500  15000  Oak to BG&E 5A2551  4003  Corn to BG&E 5A2551  383  Lebanon to BG&E 5A2526  3947  Corn to Leidy Total  23,333 dt Angie and Beavy are working on the fuel waivers for July.  And we can still take 7950 dth from Cornwell. Please terminate the following CNG contracts effective 6/30/2000.  For June, we released this capacity to Energy Express.  Boston Gas recalled this capacity effective 6/30/2000.  I changed the deal tickets in Sitara. k# 560104 5A2529 ENA is selling EES gas on CGAS.  Sitara deal #225818.  EES is showing a price of $3.347 for May production and we are billing them $3.324, which price is correct? Thanks Hey Z, would you show Beavy how to request the CNG Fuel waivers for July?  I want Beavy to do it for a couple of months so she will be aware of our operational flexibility. Remember, you need to keep track of all of this on your 2000 accomplishments for your year end review. Thanks. Paul is out of the office today but I found the customer name in my notes - it was right below all my notes on CanFibre.  The customer is Latrove Steel.  I'm going to call Peoples myself to learn how this works.  Does anyone object to that?  I will wait until this afternoon before I call. Heidi Do you think the production gas can be moved to EES's pool by July 1st?  If not, we can sell the gas to Latrove out of CES's pool for July.  However, we will not see the fuel credit until August(? ? ? ) to verify if this works or not.

It needs to be verified with PNG that I can do a pool to pool nomination to the end-user (only a few stand alone customers are grandfathered to receive these types of noms. )  This is a critical issue for EES as we are already long gas behind the gate and we don't need more production.  If the customer can't take my gas from my pool then I will have to bring it in via CNG which will only make my pool longer. 2)  If the production meters are moved to EESs' pool then I would suggest just a flat index price between ENA and EES. 3)  Will EES be supplying the full 1000/d to the end-user or just the amount of the local production transferred to EESs' pool?  4)  If the fuel credit works the way Chris explains it below then I would be willing to sell all of the gas at index but I will need to confirm that with PNG.
