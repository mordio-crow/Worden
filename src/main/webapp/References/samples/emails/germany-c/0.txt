Chat with Alan at EES, I bet its the same escript you currently use.   This might be one of those "let me get Alan to help me for a free lunch" things. I sold CES 174 dt/day (deal 335917) from the 20th through the 31st,  at a delivered price of $4.395.  We are using ENA transport for pricing purposes. Sorry dude, I don't have his number. And I finished my first civil war book.  I'll try to get that to you. Where should I invest my money? Is this something Scott did for you?  He has been handling all the TCO activity.  Let me know if this is something I need to do. jporte1@columbiaenergygroup. com on 07/13/2000 08:14:25 AM To: " - *Chris. Germany@enron. com" <Chris. Germany@enron. com>, " - *Scott.

Could you please track that down? I tried sending this email about 3 weeks ago and had problems.   So here it is. Actually, we should be nominating only 4,000 month from Power Gas and 300 day from Phillips Production.  That works out to about 429 day.  I just spoke to Samson and he agrees the volume for July should only be 4,000 for the month.  AND Angie (my super fantastic, can't say enough good things about her, will probably be my boss someday and sometimes acts like it,  CNG scheduler) has agreed to help out any way she can.  She knows escript pretty well.  Chat with Doug, if you guys agree, Angie can use your ID and password and figure out how to run all the reports we need back to January.  Also, we will not know the actuals for July production until September sometime. Effective August 1st, the Phillip's wells should be transferred to Clinton's brand new pool and Clinton will also nominate the Power Gas pool gas. Doug, John Singer said he does not have any production reports from Heidi.  With Angie's help, we could probably clear up the CNG LDC activity fairly easy. Let me know what you guys think. kdestep@columbiaenergygroup. com on 07/18/2000 02:02:39 PM To: " - *Chris_Germany@enron. com" <Chris_Germany@enron. com>, " - *pleanza@enron. com" <pleanza@enron. com> cc: " - *Kinney, Doug" <dkinney@columbiaenergygroup. com> Subject: PNG Local Production July 00 Hi Paul and Chris, Our friend Sampson at Power Gas still maintains that their local production behind PNG has not been nominated for July yet, which was 7500 dth/month.  Did you guys do a deal for this gas too?  He usually nominates it all on one day, so Clinton/CES needs to coordinate with him what day to do it on (right now the gas is out there on his side on the 17th).  I know Heidi nominated the Phillips gas baseloaded thru the month at 443/day, but I was not sure about the Power, until I checked and
