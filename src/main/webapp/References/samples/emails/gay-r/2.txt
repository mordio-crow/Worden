Siemens EOT settlement?  Tried to set something up with you on Friday but did not hear back.  In any case attached is the latest version of the document that covers the issue.  This should not be sent to the banks since we are still negotiating with SCC however it gives a good indication of where we are going.  If you need more information pls give Cliff a call or I can be reached tomorrow in Cuiaba.  In any case next week we plan on closing this issue with Siemens and need bank sign-off real time as discussed. rgds Laine That's great for me.
