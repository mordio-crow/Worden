I am waiting on input from Rick concerning the Vintage deal. When I open this letter there is nothing there.  Can you send again? I need the PPA reference for the Eletrobras performance guarantee.  Quickly please - this has to go out tonight. In preperation for our call, the memo which was requested.  I will also be able to brief you on this week's progress with Furnas.  I have a lawyer tracing the section reference for the Eletrobras performance guarantee which appears as brackets in the memo.  I should be able to advise you of the exact reference tomorrow morning when we talk. Regards, Rob I've updated the memo to insert the missing references.  I also learned that he meetings with ONS and ANEEL are scheduled for tomorrow.  Thanks The banks have given us the  green light on gas.  That means that they will be prepared to fund with the back-up agreements only, even if the YPF GSA is being re- negotiated or if we are in discussions with other suppliers. All the Best. Jim You have meant a lot to countless people and their families.  The Gays in particular will be forever in your debt.
