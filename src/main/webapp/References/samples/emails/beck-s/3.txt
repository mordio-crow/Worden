I'm off to the seashelling capital of the world . . . Here's my travel itinerary should anyone need to reach me: Going: Wednesday, Nov. 8 Delta 1258 to Atlanta - leave 9:15 A. M. Delta 1920 to Ft. Myers,  Florida arrive florida 3:35 P. M. Return: Sunday, Nov. 12 Delta 1677 to Atlanta Delta 4741 to Austin arrive Austin 6:30 P. M. Staying at Sanibel Harbour Resort & Spa in Ft. Myers, Fla 941-466-4000 I won't have my cell phone with me, so if you need to reach me, leave a message for me.   My roommate, should they not be able to locate my name, is Laura Suarez.   We're all with the loud and overly-extroverted USTA group. Should you need to reach Chris, call his work no. at 477-8787 and they will be able to tell you how he can be reached in Singapore.    Wanna call Erica? She's having her last hurrah at the farm - so I wouldn't disturb her if you know what's good for you. Cara White Community Development Coordinator USTA Texas Section 1-888-883-6388 cWhite@texas. usta. com Mark Frevert has reviewed the attached addition to the upcoming organizational memo and has asked that I forward it to you to be included.  This would be included in the section under Commercial Support, added as an additional bullet point beneath the one that addresses Business Analysis and Reporting (I believe that these bullet points are on Page 3 of the draft memo).  Please call me at x35926 if you have any questions.  Great - we will look forward to seeing you on the 13th and 14th.  I will work on an agenda this week, and will send you something later in the week.  --Sally I hope that each one of you will arrange your schedules tomorrow to make the time to vote.  Also, please encourage everyone on your staff to take the time to vote tomorrow.   For those employees who typically work later hours, please suggest that they take the time to vote before coming to the office.  Everyone should feel that they have sufficient time to make their vote count.  It should be interesting to watch the returns tomorrow evening.  Hopefully, we will have all played a part in the outcome.  Thanks for setting this up and for copying me on the schedule.  Hopefully, this will be fruitful for everyone.   And maybe unnecessary at some point in time!  Thanks.  -Sally To: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Earnest/HOU/ECT@ECT, Stephen Stock/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Re: ERMS/TAGG floor support  We are starting the 4-weeks floor support today, 11/2.
