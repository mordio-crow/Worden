I have a meeting on it this morning.  Please comment to the draft I sent to you yesterday.  I don't know if the structure works.  I couldn't decide upon the format; it also looks like a cap.  Thanks.  SS Sorry, the product must be ready next week.

I spoke with Mike Schneider (who contacted me - he's at 212-648-1164) to confirm our agreement and wanted to let you know that he was apologetic for having not having "better rates" to charge ENA.  He said he's been after Enron's business for some time and hopes to reduce rates in the course of business, if possible.  I thought you might want to have this bit of information.  Regards.
