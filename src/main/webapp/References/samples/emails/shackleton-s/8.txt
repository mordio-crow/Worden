Do you want me to send a "sample governmental master agreement" which would not be tailored specificlally for WAPA?

The legal terminology is identical for each product.  However, Stuart needs to provide a title for each product which will also appear in the Paragraph 1. The former Paragraph 2 has been deleted (it contained the "confirmation terms") and the remaining paragraphs renumbered. Justin:  Will you circulate the revised long description (since your conversation with Stuart yesterday afternoon)?  Also, will you let us all know when we are competely done? Please call with comments as soon as possible.

In addition to ENA, ECC is feeling the pressure of delays for obtaining corporate guaranties caused by increased guaranty requests, too few signers and insufficient legal staffing to handle the volume. Although Clem will have assistance soon, we concluded that it would be prudent to begin negotiation of a guaranty immediately rather than wait for the conclusion of the master agreement (or confirmation) negotiations.  Please try to incorporate this approach, particularly with Canadian counterparties. Credit will continue to push our internal form of Enron Corp. guaranty.

Am currently working to produce the confirm format.  SS Tracy: The Allegheny swap side letter provides that the parties will make a good faith effort to negotiate the ISDA master by April 6.  I am waiting with the firrst redraft of the agreement but can't get a response from anyone as to whom and where to send (via email).  I've left voice mails for Yair and Kate at Allegheny and Lauren at Sullivan and Cromwell. Can you exert some pressure here?

I left a voice mail for Yair Yaish and for Laurie Peddicord but have not heard back.  Can you provide me with the latest information?  Are you the
