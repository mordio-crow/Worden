Glover RECAP:  This is Project Moosehead.  After the meeting, we determined that the transaction should be structured as a cap and not a swaption.  The Fixed Price is the premium.  The Strike is the Cap Price (remember, strikes are for options and strikes are cap/floor in those deals).  We'll need to revise today to send in the morning.  CP is "Merrill Lynch Capital Services, Inc. ".  Enron party normally is ENA but we may change to EPMI and create a new ISDA Master for the deal.  There must be a zero floor (ie, no negative payments in the other direction).  Don't worry about weekend quotes yet because we may eliminate weekends and extend the term of the deal. Could you begin revising?  Also, do the calculations work?  Please feel free to call me as I'm buried in my office today and things change as the day goes on.  SS Susan: Are you the "someone" who will prepare execution copies?  Strange.

No need to call back but here are my comments: Allied Waste North America - please follow up on your own as the paralegals don't have the resources right now for handling all of Sam's load FirstEnergy Services Corp - please have your assistant redline changes since this is also one of Sam's items City of Palo Alto and Macquarie Inc. (or "Bank Ltd") -  neither of these are on anyone's radar screen so please proceed as you wish Proctor & Gamble - please return to me for further handling.
