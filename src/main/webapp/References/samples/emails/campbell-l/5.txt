for their availablity during that week.  Should I or someone else contact Rod Bosche or let Louie do this from his end with our legal contacting their legal? Some of the highlights that I had requested to Ralph for his presentation was the following: PCB's are a contaminant, just as benzene is, which occurs naturally in the gas.  Health issues of PCBs in pipeline are not a concern especially from a  customer and employee standpoint (the name PCB lends itself to public outcry of the unknown) Removal of PCB's is best accomplished by managing liquids, not deconing Fiilter separators are a proven method of PCB removal Transwestern's proactive assistance with SoCal on their system to manage their PCBs Most pipelines on the east coast have PCB's and no adverse environmental impacts have occurred Michel Nelson 03/28/2000 09:18 AM To: Larry Campbell/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc: Louis Soldano/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Rick Craig/OTS/Enron@ENRON, Michael Terraso/OTS/Enron@Enron, Rick Cates/ET&S/Enron@Enron, William Kendrick/OTS/Enron@Enron, Butch Russell/ET&S/Enron@Enron Subject: Re: Ralph Komai, Training Presentation  Excellent - If possible, I would wish to attend, as well. I approve the expense and hourly rate. Might be the bargain of the century.

He has stated that he would be available to do this as long as Transwestern picks up his expenses and hourly rate  ($200.00/hr).  As per your approval, Louie, I will inform Ralph that we are in agreement with his conditions and I will schedule a day when he would be available in California to put on the training for PG&E. A meeting was held with the Roswell Team at C/S No 8 discuss roles and responsibilities of the Title V Operating Permit for the Corona C/S. The sale of the TW Crawford C/S has been cancelled.  A permit revision was requested to the Air Quality Bureau to transfer the new permit to the existing facility to keep intact the ability to conduct turbine power unit replacements without agency notification. Preparations are in place for the forthcoming meeting between PG&E and Transwestern over PCB issues on their mainline.  Analytical shows that the PCB's are continuing to move further downstream into their system.  Ralph Komai, with SoCal, will make a presentation concerning  SoCal's experience with PCBs on mainline and LDC systems and present it during the 4/20 meeting in San Francisco. The annual certification for the Atoka No. 3 C/S was reveiwed for completion and submitted to M. Nelson for signature. I would be honored.  Do we meet there or somewhere else?
