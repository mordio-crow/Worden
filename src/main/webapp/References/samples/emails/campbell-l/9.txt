Team San-Juan 05/15/2000 10:13 AM To: Larry Campbell/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Butch Russell/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Rick Smith/ET&S/Enron@Enron, Rich Jolly/ET&S/Enron@Enron cc:  Subject: Sign Off Larry Rick Smith sent you my Environmental Two that Butch Russell signed me off on. I need to know when we can get together so that you can verify it. Tracy Kuehl 1. Status of Mainline Filter Separator Project. Earl Chanley has indicated that the June 1 target date for in service is on schedule.  There will be 2 mainline separators for each mainline system.  PG&E is also on schedule for June 5 & 7 pipeline tie ins to each bank of separators.  The only outstanding issue is an air permit for the 1200 gallon tank at the separator installation site.  This is a PG&E issue and will not create a delay of the in-service date.  All other permits and approvals, according to PG&E, are in place. PG&E has stated that after operation of the separators, they will want to discuss maintenance issues with ET&S. Post construction of the separators will result in 2-50 ft joints of 34 in. pipe.  PG&E will perform wipe tests on each piece to determine reuse and or disposal.  If the pieces test  to be regulated by state and federal, PG&E will consult their legal group to determine whether they will decon or dispose as a PCB regulated material.  If the decision is to decon, PG&E has indicated that they will seek another contractor other than Vector to reduce costs associated with cleaning the pipe. 2. Review Test Results of Ongoing Gas Sampling. Update since last sampling discussion in San Francisco.  Good news is that at MP 353 (kettleman C/S), latest sampling showed non detect.  The third round of sampling taken at this location is not available.  All other samples collected at suspected liquids locations areas showed PCB liquids results to be decreasing  toward Hinkley C/S.  Line 311 is a 12 in. line which travels north to Ridgecrest, Ca  also feeds  IMC Chemical Plant.  Previous testing showed non detect.  Most recent sample showed 22 ppm.   Second sample has been collected but results are not available.  Samples are proposed to be collected at the IMC Chemical Plant.  There is a potential for the IMC Plant to be PG&E's biggest single commercial customer and therefore, this site is considered to be a sensitive area relating to PCB's. Kern River Station continues to show PCB concentrations  of 1-3 ppm.   The gas from this location feeds into a portion of the Southern California Gas Co.  system which is PCB free. 3. Discuss Future Sampling Process and Frequency. West end of the PG&E system has not been sampled.  The east end of the system has at least 2 rounds of sampling conducted.  Sampling frequency for these locations is once every two weeks.  When a sampling location is shown  to have liquids, it is resampled
