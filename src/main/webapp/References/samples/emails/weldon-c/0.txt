Thanks for the link.  Sounds like they are doing well.  I'm sure that it is due to our analysis and advice. I assume Mary has had her baby?  How is everything? As for deer hunting,  it's been really exciting as we've been seeing lots of young and middle aged bucks and a bumper crop of fawns for the first time in my memory of over 15 years of hunting there.  I have not taken anythin but our hunters have gotten a 9, 10 and 11 point.  The 10 point grossed 135 B&C swhich is not giant but a darn respectable deer anywhere in the US and outr third largest ever.  (For calibration, mine grossed 166). I have one good 8 point that's about 18" wide and 4.5 yeears old but I may let Weldon shoot him as he has not gotten a deer there in 6 years of hunting.  I'm still open to you going there to take pictures.  It may be hard to schedule but I really would not mind if you wanted to go down there and  tkae some pics on your own.  I've got one blind at which the feeders are close and the deer move nearly all day.  You could drive down for the day and easily snap some good photos from sunup to sundown or from noon to sundown, whatever.  Call me at 281-807-6802 if you are interested and we can work it out. Melissa and Hunter are doing well.  He's 4 now and will start pre-school next year.  We may have another one on the way but we're not sure yet. Enron is great and everything I hoped for really.  I will be rotating as scheduled to a new role in Feb/Mar.  How are things at Dell? Later, Charlie Remi, Thank you very much for your obvious interest and commitment to doing a high quality job in your PRC representative role.  Per your request, I am attaching my resume and a brief outline of my contributions during the last few months.
