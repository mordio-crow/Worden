contract for DS-3 bandwidth between New York City and Los Angeles o= n=20 a Global Crossing network. (DS-3 is an industry standard for moving data at= a=20 speed of 45 megabits per second, fast enough for streaming video. ) Enron delivered 1,399 months' worth of DS-3 broadband capacity in the third=20 quarter alone and is on target to meet its year-end goal of 5,000 DS-3=20 months. Both Lay and Skilling think bandwidth trading will contribute $1 billion in=20 annual operating profits in five years, or nearly as much as wholesale ener= gy=20 contributed=20 in 1999. Meanwhile, the company expects to pour another $650 million into= =20 broadband services during each of the next two years, offset by the pending= =20 $2=20 billion sale of Portland General to Sierra Pacific Resources (NYSE: SRP). The other major piece of Enron's broadband strategy centers on delivering= =20 streaming video. Using Sun Microsystems (Nasdaq: SUNW) servers and switches made by Lucent Technologies (NYSE: LU) and Cisco Systems (Nasdaq: CSCO) ,= =20 along with its own internally developed software, Enron's broadband system is built to whisk data around Internet traffic jams.

"Video will be the king application," Skilling says. "That= 's=20 where=20 it's all going to happen. " Other Growth Drivers Some people may have questioned Enron's decision to plunk down $100 million= =20 for the 30-year naming rights to Enron Field, the Houston Astros' new=20 retractable-dome baseball stadium. But the deal also helped Enron seal a=20 30-year, $200 million agreement to outsource the energy management of the= =20 stadium. So Enron not only boosted its corporate profile but also made $100= =20 million in the process. Energy outsourcing is a potentially immense market, considering that U.

Enter Enron Energy Services, which does everything= =20 from analyzing a company's energy supply chain to pinpointing its=20 energy-guzzling equipment to financing the cost of buying more-efficient=20 gear. The group spent nearly a year under the hood at Simon Property Group (NYSE: SPG) before making recommendations that landed it a 10-year, $1.5= =20 billion contract to buy and manage the energy for Simon's 253 real-estate= =20 properties. "The complexity of this business is so enormous that if you're= =20 going to be the leader, you've got to know every detail," says Marty Sunde, head of the group's North American unit. Energy savings can be significant. Enron guarantees eight to 13 percent, bu= t=20 sometimes the savings can be even greater. The business, which began=20 in 1997, recently started turning a profit and is expected to have earnings= =20 before interest and taxes, or EBIT, of $80 million this year.
