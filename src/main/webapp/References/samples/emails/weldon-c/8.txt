In an effort to help the Financial Trading Group begin effectively trading = ag=20 commodities, we have attempted to locate a commercially available crop mode= l=20 to predict macro-crop effects based on real-time weather data and forward= =20 weather scenarios.  We have purchased a model known as DSSAT, which is high= ly=20 regarded in the agricultural modeling community.  One of the primary author= s=20 of this software, Joe Ritchie, has recently retired from Michigan State=20 University and is moving to Texas.  Dr. Ritchie ahs expressed interest in= =20 providing assistance to us in setting up this software.  His new address is= =20 217 Camino Principal, Belton, Texas 76513 and telephone is 254-933-7742. His colleague, Dr. Gerritt Hoogenboom, at the University of Georgia has=20 confirmed that this is the best software for our needs and that Dr. Ritchie= =20 would be ideal for providing us the help that we need. A second software product known as =01&Pcyield=018 has been suggested.  Pcy= ield is=20 based on the DSSAT model but is supposed to be more user friendly.  However= ,=20 Dr. Hoogenboom has suggested that the DSSAT model that we purchased is=20 probably the better fit for our needs.  The salesman for Pcyield is named= =20 Bill Bodine and he works for a company called Mpower 3.  He has indicated= =20 that he wants to visit us in Houston on February 2nd. Andrew, Note conference room for our meeting today.  I'm also attaching a brief writeup of the deal so far from our perspective.  You might want to review before our meeting so you will know where our current understanding (or misunderstanding :-)   )  of the deal currently is. Thanks, Charlie I'm staying away from small caps.  Note their performance yesterday in light of apparently good news.
