an argument made to dive into TXN?  It's trading at 25 forward P/E (2001) with a 5-year consensus growth rate of 24.2.  A PEG of ~1 on a high quality stock with superior technology, good management, great market position and tremendous long-term growth has got to be an opportunity, right?  What's your view? The technicals (MACD) are not great right now but I think fundamentally this is a tremendous value long-term.  It looks like the economy has really got the brakes on now (too much) but wouldn't you expect the market to begin pricing in rate cuts in 2001 pretty soon and an eventual return to high growth in technology?  I wouldn't touch any peripheral players but some of the megacap stocks with great market positions, like TXN, are sure tempting. Nasdaq down 46% from its March high and not looking good at the open.  This could be a "buy while there is blood in the streets" opportunity. As long as you have $2000, you're fine. How many Merck shares do you have left, is it just a fraction?  I think so but if not we'll just leave them in there. I have a meeting in Cuero at 10:00 am this Saturday that will last only an hour or so.  Other than that, we have no reason to go.  Maybe you could fly me to that? If so, I'll need to ask Melissa.  She would not haev to go in that case and can stay and recuperate. I need to check with Melissa first.  I'll call her now. Hold off on the reservations as I cannot get hold of her.  She may want to drive for another reason I don't know of.  How long would we have to decide if we did want to fly.  Also, could Melissa and Hunter go also. Here's a link to the data.  I'll come over there and show you where it is exactly http://gasfundy. dev. corp. enron. com/gas/framework/default. asp I'm going to get some scanned shortly.  Didn't get the CD. Ok.  I'm in a class the last two days so E-mail access is limited.  Looks like rain tomorrow so i doubt flying will work, huh? I'll call you this evening.  I'll be on this e-mail for 5 more minutes. http://www. quicken. com/investments/charts/? period=3MONTH&charttype=HIST&big=on &plot=LINE&mavg=10+50&dji=&sp500=&nasdaq=&symbol=TXN I'm in Deriv 3 class.  I just sold my remaining 2 contracts @4 3/8.  NOt too bad I have a link that looks like a lightbulb on my Lotus notes desktop.  If you don't have it, talk to your assistant.  I'll call you at lunch or on monday Date is supposed to be Feb. 1  ! ! ! We likely will come unless we are still too sick.  We've all still got the "crud".  I'll call tomorrow evening and let you know. Melissa said that she could/would make a "Football" cake if you want.  Just let me know when I call as I will not get any more e-mails today. Thanks! Thanks for the evening.  We had a good time
