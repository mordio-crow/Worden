How do I call you?  Each time I call you back, the phone goes to cover and there is no message, so I can't leave you a message. Thanks, Errol Maurice and Demetrius are doing great, and they just found out that they're pregnant!  My dad is still working --- I think they are going to have to drag him out kicking and screaming.  Where are you going to school?  How long do you have left?  I'm glad you e-mailed.  It is nice to catch up and see what your doing. What's up with the 'old' crack!

Thanks, Errol McLaughlin Mark, Deals NZ9791 and NZ9950 were done between John Arnold (gas floor) and Fletch Sturm (power desk).  Deals done between desks inside Enron do not have deal tickets, nor do they get confirmed.  The details for these deals were included in the information picked up Friday. I apologize for not relaying this sooner, but all question regarding the Management book (P&L, etc. ) need to be directed to Georganne Hodges at 713-853-0430. Attached below is the forwards detail that you requested for the LTX GD book for 12/7/01 and for the NG Price book for 12/19/2001. I am getting confirms on the deals in the table below and will call you as soon as I get them.  Please be advised that these deals are in the forwards details that I have already given you.  Also, deals QE6558 & QF4044 will not have confirms b/c they are intra-desk deals within Enron.
