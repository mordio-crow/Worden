Jeramy Wong in IT support to put together a program that will let Dutch and myself know the status of every book that should be officialized at the end of each night, so that these problems can be fixed before the morning. The book in question was officialized this morning and has zero (0) value. Please call me at X5-8274 with any questions, Errol L. McLaughlin Hey!  I hope you are having a good day.  I hate that I missed you last night.  We had a good time at the game.  The seats we had were on the floor behind the basket on the visiting team's side of the court.  We were all drinking and acting a fool so the cameraman put us up on the big screen.  A few of us went out after the game, so I am pretty tired today.  Being the alcoholic that I am, you know I couldn't just have one drink (ha ha).  I didn't want anything special.  I just wanted to catch you before you left  Be careful, and I'll talk to you tonite. See you soon, E. L. M. I'm there. The total mark to market value for US Gas EOL deals as of 09/29/2000 was: $513,520,526 Physical deals totalled $1,961,760.  Financial deals totalled $511,558,766.

Let me apologize for anything I said last night, because I don't remember anything.  We went out for a COUPLE of drinks with a recruit, and I forgot that I only got 2 hours of sleepTuesday night.  I had 2 beers and 2 shots and was at home by 10 PM, but Tuesday nite took its toll.  I sat down for 5 minutes and only woke up when I heard the cell phone ring.  I only remember picking the phone up to call you, but I don't  remember anything I said (I'm so sorry! ). Have a good rest of the day and call me when you get home.
