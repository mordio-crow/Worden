Texas 15-Katy 16-West Loop 10-Ship Channel Remaining zones in numerical order Let me know if you have any questions or problems.  Thanks. Daren I received a call from Jill Zively about our supply at mtr 5999.  Late Friday night (6/9), a portion of this gas will be delivered into Midcon instead of HPL.  The nomination into HPL for the 10th through the rest of the month will be 11,300/d.  Jill knew this would be happening, so they priced the deal at Gas Daily.  I changed deal #278748 to reflect this change for Saturday forward.  Since this is priced at Gas Daily, there will be no mark-to-market impact.  We need to review the flows next week to see how much the volume changed and adjust if necessary. Tom Engel (Sitara) has moved the big Entex ticket (#117413) for July 2000 forward to deal #292249.  This should help some with amount of time it takes to update and bridge back this deal.  He is adjusting the swap tickets also.  You should probably double check these to make sure everything looks ok.  The programmers are also trying to find ways to further decrease the time involved in updating the deal. 457 deals 13 New, 444 existing I changed the dates to 1999. D I can't make it.  Sick kids.

Everyone needs to bring their A game. Matt is out of town so we will have seven assuming everyone else will be there. Let's try to get there about 8:15 to warm up and talk about our strategy. Let me know if anyone can't make it. Bryan Apply deal 269123 to contract 012-27049-201.

Meter 5192.  I never heard back from Aimee on which Transport contract to attach the deal 269123 to so for the months in question the gas is still allocated to the Strangers Gas contract.  Aimee is out on vacation until mid-June so I put in a call to Daren Farmer to find out which Transport contract I should attach the deal 269123 to. When I find out which transport contract to use I will set up the accounting arrangements and then get Robert Lloyd to put the contract in POPS and reallocate. Fred 	 	 BH, Sorry I didn't get these to you last night.  I left the office sooner than planned.  This list is pretty slim.  I spent much time trying to learn to trade Waha, which took a considerable amount of time away from producing reults for you.  With me now concentrating on operations
