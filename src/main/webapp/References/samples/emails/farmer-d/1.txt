supply/fuel at the plant? 4)  Tenaska told us that we are supposed to be paying the suppliers and the pipeline for July and August activity.  Is this true?  I thought we weren't taking responsibility for this until September business.  We are not prepared to pay the suppliers for July. 5)  Should these deals be in an accrual or MTM book? Thanks. Daren An adjustment is required on the Tufco contract for July 2000.  The volume for the 23rd was overstated by 5,000.  This resulted in revisions on the 23rd and 28th.  Please see the attached Tufco.  If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905. D Test reply. 	 	 Apply this volume to deal 101303.  The point is on the ticket, but nothing was nom'd that day.
