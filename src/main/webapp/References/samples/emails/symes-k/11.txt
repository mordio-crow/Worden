It seems that four deals were entered by EES under the wrong desk, affecting our position instead of theirs. Following are the details of where, when, why and by how much we're out. Read this carefully. . . . SP-15 - Short 1950.64 MW Deal #500492 - 67.89 MW short off peak Deal #500493 - 87.97 MW short on peak NP-15 - Short 2883.08 MW Deal #500494 - 102.61 MW short off peak Deal #500495 - 128.89 MW short on peak If any one of you has better luck than I have at accessing EES deals in deal entry, by all means get rid of these. Or if you happen to speak with Suneet Sharma, our good friend who entered the deals in question, by all means tell him to do the same. Thanks, Kate Have fun with this! Carla just changed this deal - must have defaulted to no confirm. We do want it to be confirmed, and the deal has been changed to reflect that in Enpower. Thanks, Kate 	 	 I see that both of these deals have counterparty contact names in them now - did this get taken care of by somebody else? I'm sorry for the late response -
