deal like this and it is our reference 499390. Thanks Just spoke with Sean Crandall - he killed deal #499391. This has happened before, and seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter when traders enter off peak deals. I'll talk with IT about it; but thanks for catching this in the meantime. Kate Evelyn Metoyer@ENRON 01/18/2001 10:52 AM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT cc:  Subject: deal 499391 Hi Kate, For Ref 499391 I don't think this is a good deal because Prebon only shows one off-peak deal like this and it is our reference 499390. Thanks I've run across what seems to be a glitch in Deal Blotter; although it may be caused by the default settings in a specific trader's blotter. A few times over the last several weeks, our traders at the Short Term Southwest desk have entered off peak deals by choosing the "off" selection under the "Hours" heading. But the mask doesn't change to include Sundays and Holidays, and the traders then enter another deal to compensate for this. What we've found then is that the original deal did in fact include a strip for Sundays and Holidays, round-the-clock hours. My question is - when you enter an off-peak deal in Deal Blotter, does it automatically read that as Mon. through Sat. off-peak hours AND Sundays and Holidays round-the-clock? Even though the mask does not change to show Sundays and Holidays? I'm just wondering if there is an easier way to assure that we've entered off-peak deals correctly other than double-checking them in Deal Entry. Please call or e-mail when you get a chance. Again, this could be just a matter of incorrect settings in someone's blotter; but I'd like to make sure either way.
