Mike's looking it over. Says it's not okay until he talks with Cominco, so it probably won't get faxed back right away, since these guys are in the middle of a busy trading morning. But I'll call or e-mail as soon as they've worked out a revised confirmation.

Either way, please keep us posted.  Thanks This question is a bit dated now, but I thought I'd run it by you to make sure it's been resolved. Sound familiar? Kate Here's the latest I've heard from Willie Harrell, the Global Management staff member in charge of this job. I spoke with him briefly, and he said he expected to have the indices available in Enpower this afternoon. Jeff Richter is currently consumed with sorting out EES discrepancies for today, but we'll work on the new spreadsheets this afternoon. I'll keep you posted. Thanks, Kate You're right - bankruptcy is a likely move for PG&E. But this deal was entered in place of an existing position we had with PG&E in the California Power Exchange, and it's been approved by our legal and credit departments. Let me know if you have further questions. Thanks, Kate 	 	 498837 has been changed to Natsource. 499013 - Mike Swerzbin disputes this checkout - has 190.00 price in trade log and checked out at that price with his broker at APB. Now they're having APB look into it. I'll let you know when they resolve the price.
