e-mail @ > ryan. langan@ripcity. com Mike Swerzbin is going to contact the trader at SCEM - these are good deals. They were originally done on EOL, then changed to direct trades. Once they talk, I'll get back to you and let you know if they decided to keep or kill the deals. Thanks, Kate Stephanie Piwetz   01/18/2001 11:50 AM To: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT cc:  Subject: SCEM Deals Kate, we received two Enron confirm letters back from SCEM= and they wrote on our confirms "No record of Deal"  They were two Mike Swerzbin trades done direct: from1/10/01 Deal 493989.01 Enron Sells Scem June 2001 198.00 Mid C Deal 498988.01 Enron Sells Scem June 2001 195.00 Mid C Maybe two traders can talk, it was a note from SCEM backoffice. Thanks Stephanie These have been changed, and I sent an e-mail to our Real Time desk to remind them, once again, of the correct counterparty name. Thanks, Kate Rhonda L Denton 01/18/2001 12:47 PM To: Geir Solberg/PDX/ECT@ECT cc: Kate Symes/PDX/ECT@ECT Subject: Los Angeles Department of Water and Power Please change deal nos. 497905 and 498198 to Los Angelese Department of Water & Power. Just FYI - I believe you entered these deals on Jan. 16. What were you thinking? How long have you worked here? Can you say, "wrong counterparty name"? Also, why don't you have your own trader ID yet? Geez. Sincerely, Kate P. S. Don't worry - I corrected them for you. It's Matt Motley's deal, but all the traders just got out of a meeting, so they're still entering deals. It should show up any minute.

The only reason he entered NW delivered is because there was transmission involved. For your purposes, Sean said it's fine to change the delivery point to Mid-C (NW Delivered) in the confirms, but he didn't want to have it changed in EnPower because that would mess with the routing. Does that make any sense? Let me know if you need it changed in EnPower, and I'll talk to Sean. Thanks, Kate 	 	 Re: 491609 - This is trade date 1/5/01. It's been changed. Thanks, Kate 	 	 Tom checked with APB and they recognize the trade. Are they not checking out correctly in the back office?

These are good, and should be seen in the system momentarily.
