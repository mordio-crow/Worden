We are still awaiting details and I will report as and when more information is available. I have discussed this with Michael, and it seems that almost certainly we will need to involve outside counsel. The firm that springs to mind having both coal and litigation experience is Linklaters. If anyone has any thoughts on this perhaps they wd let me know. tks Robert Greg-- We are not in the market right now. Her credentials are good, but her timing is bad. Thanks forthe resume.
