usual attorney.  I have left an urgent message with Walker, who is out of the office in a seminar today, and won't be back in until tomorrow, to call me immediately about getting an extension of time to answer in this matter from the plaintiff.  The answer date is Monday. Richard, given that Walker is not defending us, but Scottsboro, and the small size of this case ($15,000), do we need to pass this by Jim Derrick for his approval?  Given the short time frame before an answer is due, I will go forward with retaining him provisionally, at least to get an extension of time.  I would be strongly inclined not to substitute any other counsel in, as it might give away that it is Enron Metals who is funding Scottsboro in this matter. Britt 206,500,000. I'll send you a $10 check. Please send our response to Euell to her,Vickie, and John Nowlan. Bonnie--could you call him and find out what this is about? Thx.
