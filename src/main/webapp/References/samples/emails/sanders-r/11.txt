Hi My asst, Twanda Sweet, will get them for you. 	Clement Abrams@ENRON One of their litigators--Steve Smith-- is representing Duke International in a recently filed arbitration against ENA in which Duke seeks to cancel an LNG contract with ENA that is valued at $170 million. As you will recall, this representation was the reason that we did not meet with O'Melveny when we were in CA last month.

Thank you.  Jim As you will note from the attached e-mail, the Quinque class action has been remanded to state district court in Hugoton Kansas. Robin Gibbs had always predicted that this was the likely result. We will now proceed with the battle over class certification in Kansas, which,unlike Texas, is not necessarily appealable. I will keep you posted. . yes 	"Don Schultz" <DSCHULTZ@HOLLANDHART.
