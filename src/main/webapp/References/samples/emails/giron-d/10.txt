heard about it.  I told her to get more info.  I don't know if he is a good student or not. DG My wife told me that UT pulled the offer from Robinson.  Do you know about this?  I couldn't find it on the boards. DG Hey, What's going on?  I wanted to get up to date on recruiting.  I also wanted to ask you something.  I heard some info from my wife regarding a kid that was recruited and commited to UT from Jersey Village. DG It's going to be wait and see for me.  I have a few issues this morning.  Let me know where you're going to be and I'll try to make it.

Anytime is good for me, but noon or after would be better, if this meeting runs late.  What time is good for you guys?  Also, suggestions for where would be good.  It probably needs to be central downtown since Giron is on the south side.  Let me know. Bring him in DG Please flip these if applicable. DG Russ, Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code WEST                                 GD-NEW DENVER   FT-DENVER DG    3-9573 Russ Severson 01/25/2001 02:55 PM To: Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kam Keiser/HOU/ECT@ECT, William Kelly/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Baumbach/HOU/ECT@ECT, Phillip M Love/HOU/ECT@ECT, Darron C Giron/HOU/ECT@ECT cc: George Grant/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: TDS Physical Positions In order for the physical desks to roll out positions into TDS,  a mapping is required between the Org region code used in Portcalc for the physical calc and the related Tagg book code that is used for that region. An example would be similar to: Org Region Code                             Tagg Book Code CENTRAGULF                                  FT-INTRA-GULF                        This is just an example and might not be a valid grouping TDS knows the Tagg books to pick up, it just does not know which physical region codes that are related to it. Can you provide for your desk all Org Region Codes used on your desk, and what Tagg Book it would relate to. If you could send me the list, I will forward them to the TDS developers. Any questions or concerns, please call me. Thanks Russ x37386 Please read. DG Please contact Mark and provide him with the documentation he needs.  Thanks. DG Genaro, This is a Central deal.  I work on the West Desk.  I am forwarding it to the appropriate people. DG    3-9573 Done DG You guys crack me
