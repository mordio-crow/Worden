up.  I've been out of town, and just generally swamped, so I haven't looked at alot of email.  Just went through some.  Keep'em coming, I need the entertainment!  How about Carruth?  Where's Cochran when you need him? DG Mike, DVD time huh?  I like my player, but there is a substantial premium for it.  And actually, Sony has come out with the next evolution of the mega DVD changer.  I think it lists for $900, but can probably be had for $600-$700 range.  It is also huge.  I'm not trying to talk you out of it, just let you know of the downside.  Both models have identical specs, so quality is not an issue.  Let me know if you have anymore questions. DG Frank, I know this is late.  I appologize.  I need some help with the development plan.  The review is complete.  Let me know if I need to change some items. Thanks. DG    3-9573 See if this works. DG Could you please let me have a signed original copy of your review.  Thanks. DG Done.  Sorry it took so long. DG Sounds good.  I'm available just about any day over the next few weeks.
