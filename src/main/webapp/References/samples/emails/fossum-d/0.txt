DF pls print.  thanks df pls print.  thanks df Per Louie Soldano, I called Dave Sinclair (GPG ROW) about whether we have any ability to negotiate a favorable right of way deal with the BNSF railroad.  In Dave's experience, that is a nonstarter.  Apparently, a bunch of utilities, including us through Dave, have even formed a coalition to try to figure out how to get the railroads to be more cooperative.  If the RR owns its ROW outright (which many of the old railroads do out west) we might be able to condemn an easement by getting a FERC certificate.  In other words, the RR would be treated just like any other landowner.  If we did that, Dave thinks BNSF would treat it as a declaration of war.  Since our lines cross or parallel BNSF right of way all over the place from Topock to Duluth, that would be foolish.
