comments.  I think we can eliminate the specific cross references between the two agreements, but is that the real problem or is AA going to choke on our execution of both agreements with the same party?  (that's a tough one to wire around, if it is their real concern).  Thanks.  DF pls print w/email.  thanks df Great--thanks for the thorough work.  DF I think we both ought to (and the shippers as well if someone can talk them into filing).  We aren't a shipper but we do get happy customers and maybe even more throughput from the deal, so we clearly have a legitimate interest in expedited treatment.   DF 	 	 Christmas pics?  Didn't you get the Christmas card with pics?  We shouldn't have outsourced the mail room function--quality control has gone to hell.  Come to Omaha and hang out for a couple of days and I'll give you some pics in person!  DF  Paul Gertsen <paulg@stpaul. lib. mn. us> on 02/16/2000 01:42:20 PM To: Drew.

I remember at that time, Rod Merriam told me something about how the "FBI" was looking for Flynn, at least according to his mom. I DO remember that he was filing for bankruptcy in the mid-80's. Then he dissapeared. (Used to live in Crystal, or New Hope or somewhere. ) > If you didn't get it, give me a fax number and I'll send it to you. > DF Oh,. . . . I got it. And a professional job it was, too. Notice that there is no "send to" address. Only phone #'s. Yeah- like I'm gonna call Jeff Hogue. pkg Hey-  Where are the Christmas pics of "da goils"? STEAKS?  We got em--stay at our joint and eat big meat 3 times daily.  I've got the grill set up so I can flip steaks while sitting in the hot tub drinking beer--its sort of like that Yahoo TV commercial where the sad eskimo family radically changes their lifestyle by ordering the grill and hot tub off the web.
