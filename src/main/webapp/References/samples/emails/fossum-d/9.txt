Are you sure the SW Gas point is a primary point for some of the Gallup shippers?  I didn't remember that.  If others are ok also, go for it.  Thanks. df 	 	 Yup, went over to the dark side.  On the power plant, I've got a couple of guys you need to talk to.  Steve Harris is VP of marketing at TW, and Kevin Hyatt is his right hand guy.  Steve is at 713-853-1796 and I'm not sure what Hyatt's # is.  Give me a call and I'll tell you what I can about what we're doing to help site power plants.  When did you go out-house?  I don't think I've run into you since you were running around with Shoneman.  Adios, DF.

I didn't realize that you had joined  the pipelines. I've got a client interested in developing a power plant in Arizona off  Transwestern. ? Can you give me a good contact at Transwestern? Regards, George Briden - George Briden. vcf I read Wednesday's NGPL order (RP00-18-002) as applying only to NGPL due to their unique restrictions and tariff rules.  I do not read it as forcing the rest of the industry (i. e. , us) to use the floor rate as the reserve price for negotiated index rate bids and ordinary recourse rate bids.  I think we can still determine the reserve price on a prearranged deal like the ENA deal based on our good faith valuation of the upside provided by the index mechanism.
