the same result and will hold harmless and keep [Transwestern] whole for all cost and expenses" associated with the manual system.  We will fight with them about who owes the $200k that James mentions below based on their failure to "assist" us in managing the cost.  In the mean time, we need to make sure that we are doing everything we can to get a handle on the situation to mitigate future costs.  Do we have someone who is watching this out there?  We are running so full tilt on TW that we may not have as much flexibiltiy to manage this situation as we expected, but let me know what we can do.  James had heard that one hold up was the absence of a confidentiality agreement--I guess between ECS and Transwestern--that would permit ECS to communicate to us the details on how to access teh key info. from CDEC.  That sounds like a BS excuse from ECS, but it that's what they are saying, let me know and we can figure out a solution.  Thanks.

My understanding was that ECS was to provide a means to access CDEC's online profile in order for us to make a decision to avoid running the compressor during CDEC's peak load periods.  We have not received access to this information which has resulted so far in additional electric cost of $200,987.33 for the period of July through September.  Additional cost will be incurred for the remainder of this year, that I have not been able to review yet.  This cost is averaging $79,000 per month if we continue to run the compressor as we have in August and September. Great--the front running ideas now are (1) an operational sale in the San Juan of the 20,000 we recieve there and an offsetting operational purchase (less basis differential) at some other location (i. e. , the permian) thus freeing up 20,000/d of physical space on the lateral; or (2) an exchange agreement under which a party takes our 20,000 in the SJ and gives us back the same amount, less basis differential, in the permian.  The SJ 20,000 would still physically flow down the lateral, but it would have to move under someone's transport agreement--in other words it wouldn't be incremental to our 850,000/d of firm transport obligations.  I don't know if this will work yet, but it was a creative idea by Keith and Donna.  I'm eager to talk to Steve Harris and Susan about this because it sounds similar to a scenario that Susan researched  a while ago and that Lindy explained to me--maybe there are problems or solutions yet to be considered.
