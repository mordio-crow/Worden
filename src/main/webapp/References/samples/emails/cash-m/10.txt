Twanda, here is more information about the project for Baxter.  Michelle Twanda, could you please print these attachments in color?  Thanks.  MHC Bryce, I am not comfortable with bringing someone in without an agreement.  I should have a draft to you this afternoon at the latest, so it should not be a problem for the person to start tomorrow.  I will ask my assistant, Twanda, to send you the confidentiality agreement that we require all contract personnel to sign so that you can get it to the person for signature today. Michelle 	Bryce Baxter Pete, I learned today of a deal involving a newsprint plant in New Jersey, which you are running from the legal side. Are there any issues involving personnel or labor involved in this deal?  If so, I would appreciate your getting me in the loop as early as possible. Thanks. Michelle FYI, I just learned that Jeff Golden is going to work for EES.  Michelle Twanda, I will have inserts to the two agreements for Bryce Baxter from this document.  Michelle Twanda, would you please print this for me?  I will need to have it executed.  Thanks.  MHC Talk with Mary McKendrey (may be spelled wrong), or Pam Butler in corporate comp.
