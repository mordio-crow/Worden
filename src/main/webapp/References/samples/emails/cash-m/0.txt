David, I think this point is moot for the time being because (as of last Tuesday) we are not dealing with Bidder D. I think it is ok legally to go this way -- although there is potential liability under the WARN Act (the plant closing law).  We probably can schedule around that exposure, though, by giving everyone who possibly may be affected 60 days' notice. Practically, however, this would not be my favorite approach.  I'd prefer it if we could have the ability to compete for top performers, but we should be able to manage that by working through the persons who we identify and present for possible hiring by the buyer.  I would like more information about what is meant by "ENA does not interfere with" the offers made by the buyer.  Does that mean no counteroffers? To answer the question of whether we can bind all of Enron, I would say that it is unlikely, unless we want to ask.  It is easier to commit only the wholesale group, rather than ask Corp. , EES, Broadband, etc.  whether they will abide by the agreement, so I would recommend limiting it to that group, if possible.  We may be able to include the pipelines, given that they have been involved in this transaction. Let me know if you have any questions. Michelle Was Clonch deposed?  What did he say?   Michelle I understand that Nigel is working this one.  MHC please handle for me.  thanks.  mhc please handle.  thanks.  mhc please handle for me.  thanks. mhc please handle for me.  thanks.  mhc I haven't heard anything, but I would suggest that you have them stand down for the meantime.  Michelle Richard, My thought is that the first sentence is ok, but not the second, and Bonnie is conveying that to McConville's lawyer.  MHC Hello, everyone. No need to work on Canary any more -- it is off.  I would suggest that you save your work in the event that it is revived, but it doesn't look like it is going to happen any time soon. Michelle My understanding is that the deal is dead -- stop the presses.  Thanks for all of your help on this -- I appreciated your efforts and explanations.  Perhaps we will work together again in the future. Michelle Molly, Let's schedule interviews with Bechel with Mark Haedicke, Elizabeth Sager, Sheila Tweed, Dan Lyons, and Lisa Mellencamp. Thanks a lot. Michelle Thanks, Dan.  We will work to accommodate your schedule. __________________ All: A slight change in the time.  We will meet on Thursday at 11:30.
