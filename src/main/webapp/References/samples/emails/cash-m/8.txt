<michelle. cash@enron. com>, "'Hamilton, Steve'" <steve@ecogas. com> Subject: DOL Steve Hamilton informed me this morning that the Department of Labor called him to postpone their investigation scheduled for Monday, May 15th.  They said they would call again to reschedule later.  We are still proceeding with our review and report, as are the auditors, and we hope to have our report ready by the end of this week.  Please let me know if you have any questions in the meantime. /s/ Mark A. Cover Vinson & Elkins L. L.

Getting it notarized may take a long time -- is it necessary?  Michelle Twanda, would you please print this for me?  Thanks.  MHC--my printer is not working (or maybe I haven't selected my local printer correctly)  FYI.  Here is most of the information.  Michelle Twanda, could you please start Consulting Services AGreements for these entities?  I have asked Norma to get the rest of the information. Thanks.  MHC Mark, Do we need to say something about the fact that V&E is representing Ecogas and not the plan to ensure protection of the privilege?

Let me assure you that the plan is sound, and that the assets of the plan are safely held in trust with Merrill Lynch.  The activity you may have noticed or the rumors you may have heard likely come from the fact that Ecogas has been contacted by the Department of Labor for a routine investigation of the plan.  In connection with that investigation, Ecogas has hired the law firm of Vinson & Elkins, who has visited our offices, to conduct a review and to make recommendations for improvement and for corrective action.  I cannot stress enough that Ecogas stands behind the 401(k) plan and is committed to making the necessary improvements and corrections.  I know you will join me in welcoming this opportunity to make our plan better. =============== /s/ Mark A. Cover Vinson & Elkins L. L. P. 3700
