       $4.4767  +  0.01 = $4.4867 The same transport fee and fuel percentage as last month should be deducted from this price.  I think the allocated fuel was 23 mmbtu. Also, keep in mind that we scheduled 31,112 mmbtu per Rebel's directions.  ENA will have to cash out the difference with Destin (at higher prices! ). Thanks, Susan Pereira We will not be settling the El Paso/Stingray imbalance.  El Paso insists on being paid back in kind, as opposed to cashing out at prices when the imbalance occurred.  We'll just carry the imbalance on our books.  Maybe we'll pay it back next year. Thanks, Susan Pereira P. S. -  Was new paperwork sent out to Cinergy? ? Stevens- I haven't heard back from our accounting group on what their fax number is.  In the meantime, you can just fax the invoice to me at 713-646-8453. Susan Good questions!  The volumes are at the wellhead, so the fuel volumes would need to be deducted.  Destin has changed their fuel to 0.003%.  As for the prices, the Sonat gas daily prices should be reduced by $0.24 /mmbtu transportation. Let me know if you have any more questions. Susan Here are the Gas Daily prices for Sonat on the days of allocated flow: 10/12 --  101 mmbtu @ $5.135 10/20 --    62 mmbtu @ $5.02 10/24 --    63 mmbtu @ $4.81 10/25 --    52 mmbtu @ $4.835 10/26 --  377 mmbtu @ $4.64 10/27 --  371 mmbtu @ $4.60 10/28 --  538 mmbtu @ $4.475 10/29 --    84 mmbtu @ $4.475 Let me know if you need any more info. Susan We have not received any final allocation from Destin.  I'm not sure what the holdup is.  I think Joe talked with Harvey at Rebel and communicated this to him today. Susan Helen- What is the mailing address? Susan Pereira We'll take the lesson on the 25th at 11 am.  Thanks, Susan Pereira Thanks The only info I had from you is that we owed ProEnergy 11,035 mmbtu.  I asked you if we had any other outstanding imbalances with Cinergy or its precursors.  You gave me the Onyx volume, but I had already negotiated the deal.  Whose imbalance is the 10,644 mmbtu? ? Susan Pereira Stevens- Destin does not feel comfortable with volumes yet at your meter.  They are waiting for final meter numbers before allocating to our transport contract.  That should happen some time next week.  We will send you those numbers and the prices once we receive the final allocation. Thanks, Susan Pereira If the receivable is for ENA, it will have to be settled separately.  Andy Ring talks to Koch for day trading.  Maybe she could pursue this. Susan Pereira Is this a receivable for LRC or Enron? Cinergy has agreed to settle the imbalance of 11,035 mmbtu owed them at $1.77/mmbtu.  Please prepare the paperwork showing us paying them $19,531.95 to clear this imbalance. Thanks, Susan Pereira p. s. - you can just
