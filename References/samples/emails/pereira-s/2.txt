address the letter to Daniel Kieran Leslie- We will cashout the imbalance with the two Koch entities in the following way: We owe Koch 11,885 mmbtu at $3.90/mmbtu, which equals $46,351.50. Koch owes us 13,639 mmbtu at $2.21/mmbtu and 11,720 mmbtu at $2.38/mmbtu, which equals $58,035.79. The net of these imbalances is $11,684.29 due to Enron. Let me know if you have any questions.
