David- The 22nd or 24th would work better for me.  Please check with the others on which day is more convenient. Thanks, Susan We'll be there at 4 pm on Sunday.  Thanks Susan Pereira Helen-  Would a private lesson be available on Saturday or Sunday at 4 pm? Thanks, Susan Pereira Helen- Kali will be there at 2 pm Sunday the 14th for a private lesson. Thanks, Susan Pereira Helen- Is a stand-by time available for Sunday afternoon around 2 pm?  The lesson would be for my daughter Kali. Thanks, Susan Pereira Leslie- Have you sent any confirmation to El Paso stating our agreement with the imbalance and that it has been transferred to ENA? Susan Do you know if we have actually collected on the imbalance settlement payments from Koch and LIG?  Also, are we in agreement with El Paso on the Stingray imbalance volume (11,973 mmbtu due Stingray)?  I have a statement from El Paso showing this volume.  They want us to sign and return the volume statement.  Thanks, Susan Pereira Whoops!  I goofed.  The transport deduct on gross volumes (including fuel value) is $.2602.  The transport deduct on net volumes is $.2422. Sorry for the confusion. Susan My understanding is that our deal converted to the average of three IF indices + .01 (less transport and fuel) effective November thru February.  The November price would then be $4.4767 + .01 = $4.4867 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel. The December price would be $5.9967 + .01 = $6.0067 less $.2422 less 0.3% fuel. Please let me know if this is not your understanding.  Also, please keep in mind ENA has taken losses on cashing out negative imbalances on this production. Thanks, Susan Pereira Stevens- I wanted to clarify with you the transportation costs on Destin.  The transportation rate is $.24/MMBtu and the ACA charge is $.0022/MMBtu.  This should be deducted from the net volumes received on our transportation contract.   The net volumes are the volumes allocated to our contract for redelivery after 0.3% fuel in kind has been deducted from the gross volumes at the receipt point into Destin.  If you bill us on gross volumes, then you must deduct the value of the fuel as well as the $.2422/mmbtu in transportation costs from the pipeline.  From my calculations, deducts from gross volumes would be $.258 in Oct. , $.2556 in Nov. and $.2602 in Dec.   Please let me know if you have any questions. Thanks Susan Pereira Jane- I've corrected  the transport and fuel deducts in sitara and e-mailed the EOTT  folks. Thanks Susan We were allocated a total of 7591 mmbtu at the receipt point for November.  I think our contract for November is at the average of the Inside FERC  postings for the three pipes plus a penny.  Those prices are as follows: Transco Zone 3  $4.51 Florida Zone 3    $4.45 Sonat                      $4.47 Avg
