For the past two months, I have been going to the doctor, because of a lump I found under my arm.  As a result of that I have had to have a mammogram and an ultrasound of my breast.  Both test came back abnormal and  I am seeing a specialist this week to determine if I need to have a biopsy or not. Since God has given me the task of doing a mighty work for him the devil has been busy. I trust and believe that God will heal.  God gave me a revelation several months ago that ALL IS WELL since that time, my husband and I have reunited our family, we have been blessed tremendously in more ways than I can share with you at this time, however, in the midst of those blessings, the devil has gotten mad.  So he has decided to try and pull me down once again.  I refuse to be brought down off this spiritual high that is truly a blessing from God. That is why I am calling on all you prayer warriors I need you to be in prayer with me this week.  I see the specialist on Thursday and I will know then if I need to have the biopsy. God Bless Each of you and Season's Greetings Love Marylyn ________________________________________________________________ GET INTERNET ACCESS FROM JUNO!
