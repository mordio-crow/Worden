down a brief set of directions to our retreat in Galveston please, sweetie, little kitty? Thank you! DD If you're not busy, I'll come in and check for you if you'de like. Thanks!  I will be placing it on the calendar.  Do you have the icon on your Lotus Notes workspace desktop?  It's the  "Merchant Finance on ECTHOU_. . . " icon. You are crazy.  Did you download that stuff like I told you?  Call me. Are you on the internet?  Email me. OOPS!  Here's the attachment. Hi Betty - Hope this little note finds you doing well.  Didn't we have a wonderful time of fellowship last night. ?  Claudette had such a fresh anointing on her.  She spoke so beautifully. Listen, I have your email adress but not your phone #.  Is the some reason other than the fact that I've never asked?  You can reach me @ any of these #'s. . .

Attached to this email is a Word document that lists all the MOP members names, addresses and phone #'s.  I plan to revise it more with email addresses and alternate/emergency phone #'s but for now will you help me fill in the blanks where possible?  Later, if every one approves, we can distribute this.  Let me know what you think. Lots of Love for my sister in Christ. Dana Listen MagOO!  I told you to download that stuff and view it later.  That is the only gibberish that you should be receiving.
