I am trying to do the majority of the necessary preparation for our trip before Friday.  I am also still trying to decide whether or not we will do hair tonight.  Do you already have the perm?  I did get some type of directions from Denise too.  I am printing them now and placing them in my purse so we will have them. Morning - Would you mind terribly, taking a few minutes to jot
