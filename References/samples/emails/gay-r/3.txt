this issue (among others presently facing the project) with the lenders this week.  Rob, feel free to chime in if I've misstated anything. Thanks.  I have suggested to OPIC/KFW that perhaps S&W should listen in.  We'll see if they had time to arrange it.  If not we will follow up after.

Does this work for you?  I can be reached at 55 65 9981-6071. rgds Laine We just had a call with Novak, Barquin (V&E) and Tozzini on options for next Monday such as economic equilibrium, arbitration, litigation etc. We will be putting all the results together for you by Friday Morning.  In the mean time, it may be helpful for you to reflect on the following (particularly the table). This is really starting to bring it into focus for me.  We will try to do the same for our options on Monday's decision. I contacted Graham Lofts and he was shocked and surprised.  He is going to look into the situation and get back to me tonight or tomorrow morning. I will advise when I hear.

I have a meeting with Neal Turton to provide an update on the Furnas consent and would like any new info on the matter before I meet with im. Thanks Richard A Lammers 01/12/2001 12:42 PM To: Rob G Gay/NA/Enron@Enron, John Novak/SA/Enron@Enron cc: Peter E Weidler/NA/Enron@Enron, Mark Provenzano/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Subject: Dresdner kleinwort Benson Potential Conflict of interest Rob- Dresdner KB is currently advising Petrobras on their evalution of purchasing equity interests in Transredes and the Cuiaba project. As you know DKB was also hired by Enron as the financial advisor to the Cuiaba project. We have about 800k to pay DKB at financial closint. Can you check to see  how DKB does not have a conflict of interest in this work. They need to either cease all work on the Petrobras transaction or terminate their work and rights to a fee for Cuiaba. Let me know what you think or if you need any more
