It has been a pleasure and an honor to have worked with all of you over the past few years.   I can be reached through the following numbers: Jim Bannantine email at bannant@attglobal. net phone at 55-11-247-4449 fax at 55-11-5548-5528 Cliff Rankin has indicated he won't be available until Thursday so I think we may need to shoot for the budget on Wednesday and the ECA on Thurs.

That means that they will be prepared to fund with the back-up agreements only, even if the YPF GSA is being re- negotiated or if we are in discussions with other suppliers. According to Cliff Shedd, we would be covered by insurance if we terminated the contract with Furnas and Furnas failed to pay the termination payment.  However the insurers will only pay after we receive an arbitration judgement against them and the refuse to honor the judgement.  I assume we would also have to exhaust our remedies against trhe guarantor (Eletrobras). Also, we are required to notify the underwriters immediately of a material default.   I believe that is correct.
