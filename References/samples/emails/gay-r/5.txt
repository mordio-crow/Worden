need for increased care on Cuiaba information handling due to this situation.  Let me know if you require more.  It is my understanding that Neal provided similar reasuarance at your meeting today. No, he was moving out of the region as I came in.  He worked for Rick Lammers who speaks highly of him though. Can you be available for a call with S&W on Monday 10:00 CST? Questions which arose during my discussions with Sue Garven today concerning the turbine performance and associated warranty and TAA issues. We may be able to change to 9:00 if that works for Brad and Laine as well.

Pete Rick, In preparation for the meeting with the lenders on Tuesday I was reviewing the GSA and I wonder if YPF has any force majeure claims which could impede our rights to terminate.  I know they indicated at least verbally that they had encountered some problems in Argentina.  Although a stretch has Dean or Novak indicated that this could be a defense? Interesting piece of history - my notes from a lecture I gave Bannantine Circa 2/00-4/00 The matrix with the implications of arbitration will be done this afternoon.
