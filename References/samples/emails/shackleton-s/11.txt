Check the comments for Ms. Lewis' information. 2.  No, I indicated that the assignment and account agreement were essential.  I did not say that accompanying docs were not required.  I suggested that someone should verify with Cheryl Lewis.  Often, the broker will rely on our relationship and subsequent delivery of accompanying docs.  This must be determined on an ad hoc basis.

Do we need to do something about that?  Are you supposed to receive information?

Is the worksheet attached?  I couldn't  access it.  We'll need address into from John Malowney (Portland) if Wendy doesn't have it.

I have no meetings scheduled with you tomorrow.  I don't know anything about a 9 am meeting.  The brokerage meetings were originally scheduled every other week until we could bring ourselves up to date (and we met last week).  The swap group meeting is always held twice monthly.  Hope this helps.

Please call NYSEG to follow up.  Also, Carol is reviewing the PSE&G comparison so please call her and you guys can review the ISDA together.  If you are uncertain as to how to keep in touch with our counterparties, please chat with me.  Thanks.  SS Cheryl: I think it would be helpful for the desk and legal to retain monthly meetings just to stay abreast of activity and expectations.  Why don't we keep the end of month meetings?  I'll resend the schedule to you.
