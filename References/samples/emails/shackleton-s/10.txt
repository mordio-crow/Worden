Where are your definitions of "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified Calculation Period"? In your definition of "IPA Floating Rate Payment", you use the term "Share Spread" which is not defined.  What do you mean?  There is a dangling definition of "Share Spread" at the end of the IPA Compensation section, but it refers to spreads appearing in either Annex I or Annex II. In the "IPA Compensation" section, how is "a negative IPA elected"?  Who is making an election? Let's discuss tomorrow.

We need it asap.  Thanks.  SS Tanya: Carol and I would like to meet with you tomorrow (Wed. ) at 11 am.  The credit worksheet would be a very timely issue for us.  Does the time work for you?

You didn't answer my question about "Calculation Period" and "IPA Modified Calculation Period". 2.  Are you saying that EEL "elects" to increase/decrease the Basket Component Shares? Are you saying that the "IPA Number of Shares" is negative or the IPA is negative? Is the IPA negative when the Initial Price exceeds the Relevant Price?
