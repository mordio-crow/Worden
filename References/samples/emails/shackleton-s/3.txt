com 	Nicola Beales How does the attached work for the BOFC/NDF? I am not necessarily proposing that we use this for the EOL deal.

I received a call from NY and before I called back, I checked the infamous Lotus Notes.  It seems that you were going to send a letter to NY summarizing the outstanding issues (I think there was only one issue).  Please let me know if this was ever done.  Thanks. On a sad note, I don't know if you heard but Samantha's 19-month old daughter (adoption not final) was killed in a tragic car accident last week.  The child managed to crawl under the car while it was in the driveway and Sam didn't see her.  Did you really get to know Samantha?  If so, and if you would like her home address, please let me know.

A few things: (1)  What is the correct legal name of the entity you are inquiring about?  Is it the unregulated marketing arm of the regulated utility? (2)  There has not been a commercial push from the ENA perspective to set up a new agreement with FPL which explains why I cannot get our credit  goup to react.  I'll broach the topic again when  I hear from you. Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Absent that information, it appears that we had at least one issue remaining and it concerned the disruption fallbacks, in particular, your request for both you and ENA to each obtain two quotes and then average those quotes (the ultimate fallback).  We cannot agree to your request.  The last database entry I reflect was in October, 2000, when we were having difficulty obtaining your response. Given the lapse of time, we could try to generate a blackline and review the status.  Please let me know what you would like to do.

Please confirm whether Washington (which airport) is closer to ;you.  Also, how difficult is it to get from the Baltimore ariport to you?  I'll let you know soon.  Mike will not be coming with me.
