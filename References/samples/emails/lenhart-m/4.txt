huh?  you and mark chumura hitting the prom parties.  drinking cold beer and getting hot pussy is still what it is about.  even though we work you need to get those essentials.  they are like air.  we did it right in college when we were running those chi - o's.  you should try to get to h-town one weekend and we will run some cougars. cougars= old women that pray on young men. cougars love me here.  give me a shout some time.  713-853-7176.  good to hear from you. labor day is the working man's holiday.  since most of us work we should celebrate the holiday (and jacques and val's weddings) that weekend in vegas.
