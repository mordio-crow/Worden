Heather, I am glad to hear you (and your car) are o. k.  We did not have any problems.  Those pictures are amazing!  The video of I-10 was unbelievable.  Dan and Marianne went to I-10 and saw the flooding in person.  He said the video on tv did not really show how bad it was.  Is there an estimate on when B  & P will be back in their offices?  It would be nice for you to have a couple of days off. Stacy P. S.
