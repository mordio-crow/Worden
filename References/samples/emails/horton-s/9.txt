Thanks. . . JOHN. If you are bored go work out!  That is time consuming and good for you.  That is fine with the credit card.  If you work out it is ok to go shop and put it on the credit card.  Just not too much.  By the way DK's birthday is April 30 and the JJ's are May 2.  No one expects presents but it would be nice if you got DK a card.  She is taking your car in today to be fixed.

My week is going just fine.  Nothing exciting to report.  By the way, there is $50 at Mom's that is for you because David flew home from here last night, and we had to order the ticket on the credit card.  The ticket was $68.75 so he'll give you the last $20 next time he sees you.  I hope that is ok.  You had said once that I could always use the credit card for things like that as long as I paid you back so I did.  You can either get it from Mom or wait till I get home and I'll bring it to you. With all the prom excitement I completely forgot to give it to you before we left - sorry.  Anyway, this week is pretty boring for me because I have nothing due and no exams.  I'm glad to have a light week, but it leaves for a lot of boredom and down time.  I may have to find something to do like. . . . . . SHOP! ! ! ! !  No I'm just kidding - I wouldn't do that.  Well, I'll talk to you sometime this week and have fun tonight.  I hope the rugrats feel better soon for their sake and ya'lls! ! ! !  I love you! ! ! ! Love, Caron Friday is fine with me. I am not aware of any other conflict with schedules.  I suggest we go ahead with the meeting.

The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at 11:30 that day and the Compensation Committee at 1:00.  All meetings are at the Enron building. Walt has just learned that John Duncan, Dee Osborne and Ken Lay are not available to attend any of these meetings.  This leaves two out of three for the Audit Committee and just enough for a quorum
