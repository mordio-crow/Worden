going to go to some of the Fiesta festivities around here and the big FiestaFest concert here on Friday night.  I will be home on Tuesday night though after classes and will switch back cars then.  (I'll be home Tuesday till Friday morning to bring a load of stuff home and study.  I also wanted to be there for the munchkins' b-day party - it is the first one and all. )  Thanks so much for taking care of my car and letting me borrow the Beemer.  It's been nice having it! ! !  I hope you are having a great day and I'll talk to you tonight.  I love you! ! ! Love, Caron PS - Thanks for letting the horses go to Nacodoches last weekend.  Rose won both the costume class and championship so she's qualified for Nationals in that now, and Ricki won his driving so he's qualified now too.  Rose got 3rd out of 6 in sidesaddle, but Jennifer said it was her and not Rose (fred said so too! ! ).  I'll have to get that qualification in San Antonio.  I just thought you'd like to know and tell you thanks for giving me some more classes to ride at Nationals.  Maybe I'll actually win something there this time around! ! ! Yes.  Let me know about follow=up plans. Riccardo_Bortolotti%ECT%ENRON@eott. com on 04/25/2001 08:34:33 AM To: Stanley_Horton%Enron. com%Eott@EOTT. COM, Mark_Metts%EnronXGate@EOTT.

COM, Eric_Shaw%ECT%ENRON@eott. com Subject: Azurix/Enel Stan + Mark, as you are probably aware Enel is actively looking at acquiring water businesses, particularly, but not only, in the UK . They are also generally interested in opportunities in South America . We are always looking at things that could attract Enel' s interest in order to help us get our hands on some power and potentially gas positions in Italy . Moreover, Enel is cash rich and has proven to be a very generous buyer, when it comes to acquisitions in areas of business ( gas, water and telecoms ) that can help them to fulfil their vision to become  a multi utility . I have got some decent contacts at the decision making level . Would you be interested in discussing a potential approach ? R Workout, study, study and then go shopping for something new.
