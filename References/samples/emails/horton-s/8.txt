many years.  It just is not worth the time and risk for that kind of money.  I think Phil Lowry agrees with this assessment also. I waited to get you one until they worked out all the kinks.  See how thoughtful I am. I assume you have taken care of this and Jim is available immediately Looks good to me. The information should have been sent to you by now.  I was out of town last week.  Sory about the delay.  Email is a great way to comminicate on this.  Thank you. I will call you tonight to catch up on the prom etc.  Orlando was ok.  Nothing great.  By the way, DK, the twins and I will be in Florida June 30 - July 10.  When are you coming?  We will need to get plane reservations ASAP. "Caron Horton" <Caron.
