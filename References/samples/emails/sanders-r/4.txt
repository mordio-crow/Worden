Richard, Folllowing our meeting of the 9th November, I have now written a business requirements document, which will be included in the final specification to be sent out to the vendors under consideration for the supply of voice recording services. This document is attached below. Before sending out this document I wanted you to have the opportunity to review the content and comment upon any statements made within it. In order to progress this component of the ECS project we will be sending out a specification at the end of November, so if any feedback could be given before that deadline, it would be appreciated. I will ensure you are also sent a copy of the final specification provided to the suppliers. Thank you for your assistance with this matter. Regards Stuart Fieldhouse Who are we designating?
