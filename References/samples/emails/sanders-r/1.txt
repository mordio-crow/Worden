Also-- any luck on my proposed meeting w/the Legg Mason? 1:30 is good. I will call you. 	SHoward@milbank. com My first reaction to this meeting was pretty negative. It seems like alot of busywork.  My second reaction was to recognize that Enron has a long term strategy of getting to know the insiders at AAA better, so there is some benefit to the meeting. However,there has to be a tightly controlled agenda or our business people(and lawyers) will lose patience quickly. The transactional lawyer who is responsible for EnronOnline is Mark Taylor ext 37459. I explained what was going on and he is expecting you call.
