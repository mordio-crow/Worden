The plans are up in the air. The first weekend that everyone can make it Lets have a conf. call w/ you, me, and Mike Day on Mon. morning. 	"Fergus, Gary S. " <GFergus@brobeck. com> The status of the case has not changed. On Monday the 27th the court will hear our Motion for Summary Judgement on liability. We expect to win. Badack is contesting the damages and we will be required to endure some discovery. I predict we will have a judgement that we can excecute on by the 1st Q. Badack has increased its settlement offer to $2.4 million. We have offered $4.5 million.

Our litigation team headed by Richard Sanders is still negotiating with the company on some possible settlement.  We may need to write this balance down at some point.  I am not sure when to expect resolution to our negotiations. We will keep you posted as it progresses. Bill The only one I am aware of is Kimball,which Lisa is handling. 	William S Bradford yes 	Britt Davis@ENRON Did you get everything you needed? Can you confirm that we corrected this? Sorry for the delay. What information, if any, do we owe him? Please review and let me know if you have any comments. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I have asked my asst, Twanda 713-853-9402, to set up a call for tomorrow. 	melanie. gray@weil. com I agree that we should send such a letter. Also-- I talked to Mike Beatty and he is willing and able to serve as our party designate arbitrator. I told him that Neal would follow up with him on the details. 	"Neal S.

There is nothing wrong with a REAL negotiation, but nothing particularly helpful about generating one that s just for show. Particularly in the absence of any entreaty from them. Where is the "simple" explanation of the transportation piece? As I have told RNR, I think we should advise Duke in writing that its IP is not in conformity with the contract, sinceit is in the alternative, and that our IP is hence the only one that will be before the arbitrators (since Duke clearly cannot change it's ineffective IP at this stage, having already seen ours).  Accordingly, the only issue left for arbitration is whether our IP (the only one and therefore the one they have to choose) is or is not an economic hardship under the contract.  What say ye? none 	Susan Rance@ENRON 	11/28/2000 03:58 PM 		 		 To:
