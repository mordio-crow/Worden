is value to your seeing the ship, I'm ok with your detour.  Let me know before you go what you intend to find out if anything. Regards Jeff 	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. - Europe 	 This is another reason why the HR and A/A program don't like each other.  It's absurd that our personnell functions don't share resources.  I'm almost of the opinion that these two groups should be folded together.  Jeff put on calendar I will be out of the office oct 9.

Jeff  what time is the soiree friday eve?   Jennifer Fraser is leading our fundamentals intranet group for all products within EGM.  Please contact her so we do not duplicate efforts, as the coal, etc site will be incorporated with some uniformity into the larger EGM site.   Thanks.  Jeff 	 	 please print somewhat surprising, but we'll take it print I'm not sure our plan is to collapse the LNG shipping group into coal (I presume you mean under Pierre).  However, we have to look at our internal and external options.  If you look at the structure of  the exmar vessell it is certainly far from ideal for enron.  In fact it appears to be quite one-sided.  First we must look at what we want this group to be, and examine what skills each of the internal players can bring to the table--(including Pierre and Wayne).  Second estabish internal procedure, and trading capabilities.  Third, execute.  I would agree that LNG shipping is a unique animal, but before we hire anyone externally, I'd like to get everyone together to discuss the most appropriate way forward. Thanks.  Jeff 	Rick Bergsieker@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT love to help,
