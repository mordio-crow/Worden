The only thing we are precluded from is building a power plant in Singapore. . . 	 	 Very strong need for people in Japan next august.  I'd like to get some people interested in helping start there, or get there after some enron indoctrination.  Thanks.  Jeff Yes, absolutely.  There is a ton of work in Japan, and as you know Joe Hirl runs the office, but the products in EGM are crucial to its success.  I'd be happy to meet her.  Let me know how I can help.

He's definitely worth putting on the interview list. As for Japan opportunities, is there a way to get Tess Dyar plugged into those?  She just started (from Wharton) after spending nearly 10 years at Goldman in Japan.  She definitely has an interest in continuing her work with the country.  I think she's been a little disappointed since getting here and seeing APACHI dissolved.

Jeff If he is good, we have a lot to do in Japan. Glad to be of help.  Let me know if you ever need anything from me.  Regards.

I think your story was an extremely valuable one.  It is good for the students to hear that there is a life outside Wall Street, and that their desire for challenge and stimulation can be more than fulfilled outside of New York.  It is also good for them to hear that there is not one answer to any particular question, and I appreciated that you and all of your colleagues pushed back when they pressed you for THE ANSWER.
