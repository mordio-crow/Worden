then backdated it for 1/8. I was going to ask him about the delivery point just as you called him - sorry we crossed paths. Let me know if there is anything else. Kate I've had a request from Matt Motley to begin receiving this table on a daily basis. Carla Hoffman said Bob Badeer had asked for it before, and for whatever reason she held off distributing it to all the traders. I'd like to know if there is some reason why we don't send the EOL table to all the traders on a daily basis. If not, may I copy them on this in the future? Thanks, Kate This actually makes him look better. 	Enron Capital & Trade Resources Corp. 	 This has been changed. And regarding the EES acquisition from the end of last year, I spoke with Kim Hundl briefly about it yesterday. I was a little unclear about the question in your e-mail to Carla, which was forwarded to me. Please give me a call or shoot me an e-mail, and we'll figure this out. Tracy Ngo, our Portland credit person, knows all about it, so between us we should be able to clarify this. Thanks, Kate 	 	 I just received the e-mail regarding your visit to Portland (Monica Lande forwarded it to me). Regarding that, I would definitely be interested in gaining access to Livelink. Monica explained that Livelink is a system that allows one to view confirms, in which case it would greatly benefit my position to have access to it. I look forward to your visit, and to working with you in the future. Thanks, Kate Symes West Desk Deal Control 503.464.7486 Matt says this trade is definitely Q3-02.
