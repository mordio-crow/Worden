These deals are all parts of sleeves we did for EES, and we only include a broker fee on the sale side of the sleeve. I ended up changing just two deals; they're highlighted in red: 459812 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve) 459813 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side of EES sleeve) 457489 - no change (buy side of EES sleeve) 457490 - no change (sale side already contained .0075 broker fee) 468444 - added .0075 broker fee (sale side) 468440 - no change (buy side) And as a disclaimer - I'm getting my information from our traders, so if any of this sounds incorrect, or if Natsource still disputes, please let me know.
