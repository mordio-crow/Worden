Let me know if this is what you wanted. It looks like 491916 duplicated a strip contained in 491893. I spoke with Diana Scholtes, and she wanted to keep both deals, but she deleted the extra strip in 491893. Let me know if this works with Tacoma.

Re: Note I left on your desk. Could you take a look at this deal when you get a chance? Thanks, Kate I've forwarded this message onto Christian Yoder, one of our lawyers. Chris Mallory and Jeff Richter suggested I check with Christian first on the language of these confirms. I'll get back to you first thing tomorrow. Thanks, Kate 	 	 Thanks! I handed off the fax to Christian, who said he was extremely busy today but would try to get to it this afternoon.
