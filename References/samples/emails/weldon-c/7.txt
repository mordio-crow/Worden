and your kitchen looks great! Love, Charlie Thanks for the info.  The $300 is definitely far more than we expected or think she deserves so we appreciate it.  No need to send any more, really.  If you want to give her more, then you can put it toward a Christmas present or something.  Are you going hunting this weekend?  It's going to be cold and probably wet so it should be perfect. Charlie   Sounds like Goldman has a pretty low opinion of Dupont's management.  not surprising. . . . . Yep. If you are looking for a free trip to Austin, you should go to this. This could be big. . . http://biz. yahoo. com/rf/010129/n29305829. html This could turn into something big. . . . http://biz. yahoo. com/rf/010129/n29305829. html I finally awoke sometime later.  Our trip was pretty good but the game kinda sucked.

We have a group dedicated to looking at new energy technology investment opportunities so I'm confifdent we won't miss out on any opportunity in this market. I got your e-mail.  We are planning on coming.  Melissa is better, not totally well, but may be on her way to recovery. Sorry about Jimmy.  He's having a heck of a time. Kristin, Attached is a file with the data and graphs of some of the BC rivers you requested.    I only got an exact match on station in a couple cases and in many of the cases the dataset is limited.  Additionally, I added some other stations that had what might be some useful data even though they were not the exact station requested.  To firm up whether or not these surrogate stations are valid, I need a very detailed map of the region.  I assume whoever needs this info has one. Anyway, take a look and let me know what you think.  This file is a good representation of the type of data available on the CD.  It may not be perfect but I'm afraid that we will have a pretty tough time getting better data from any other source.   (Not that I will give up though) Thanks, Charlie try this one. . .  http://biz. yahoo. com/rf/010129/n29329725. html I think I better stick around my new job for a little longer before I run off.  I've got a training class again next week so I'm going to be out 2 days. I think I'm going to Austin in late Feb for the internship interviews. That sounds good.  Thanks $1 from you and $151 from Vikas on my MArch Nymex trade I closed today.  Yeah! Dwivedi Here is an excerpt from my write-up on my projects. . . . 3.  Agricultural Modeling
