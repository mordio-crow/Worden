You have the right Sally Beck.  I grew up around the corner from your dad and used to eat Thursday fried chicken lunches at Tattie's house (now your house) with Jim and the whole family.  Plus your mom and I used to spend the night at each other's houses when we were in elementary school.  I had heard through my sister Cara (who interviewed your grandad for a USTA publication) that you were heading to Enron upon graduation.  I would love to visit with you about your experience so far at Enron.  Call my assistant, Patti Thompson, at x39106 and let's set up a time to get together.  Monday or Tuesday next week would be good.  I look forward to seeing you.  By the way, our oldest daugher, age 16, is Meagan Worthing Beck.   --Sally I have only taken a quick look at the attachment, but thought that I would forward it to you.  Does it make sense?  $8MM in equipment charges for us? ? ? ? ? ? ?  Does that include depreciation (which is not equipment)?  Can you give me the detail again on everything that falls under the "Consultant" line?  What is it and which RC's and RC owners have items there.  Thanks.  --Sally I know that there was a pretty serious set of audit findings from the TX RRCommission earlier this year.  I suspect this is a result of that.  Brenda Herod was involved in the download meeting with the rep from the TRRC.  If she hasn't already told  you about that meeting, you may to visit with her on that.  --Sally Good memo.  I will be curious to see if you get any comments or response from the commercial guys.  --Sally Brent A Price 11/09/2000 03:39 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jeffrey A Shankman/HOU/ECT@ECT, John L Nowlan/HOU/ECT@ECT, George McClellan/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark Tawney/HOU/ECT@ECT, Jere C Overdyke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Gary Hickerson/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Gonzales/LON/ECT@ECT, Rick Bergsieker/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Daniel Reck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Larry Lawyer/NA/Enron@Enron cc: Sally Beck/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard Causey/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Scott Earnest/HOU/ECT@ECT, Kevin Sweeney/HOU/ECT@ECT, D Todd Hall/HOU/ECT@ECT, Sheila Glover/HOU/ECT@ECT, Eric Groves/HOU/ECT@ECT Subject: Fundamental Operating Standards Attached for your review are the fundamental operating standards and controls that have been developed by the Wholesale Services group.  These standards are to be met by all Enron offices and by each functional group within the operations process.  Qualitative standards should be viewed as the basic measures to be taken when opening a new office or trading a new commodity.  Statistics measuring compliance with quantitative standards will be monitored on a daily basis and any issues that arise will be addressed immediately. As business unit heads, you play a critical role in working with Operations to ensure that proper controls are in place and working effectively.  Please review this document and let me know if you have any questions or wish to discuss further. Regards, Brent I couldn't agree with you more.  Mike missed the point of our phone call this week.  It was not to discuss the fine points of doorstep process or etiquette!  The point was ownership of
