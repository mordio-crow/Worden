the three of you.  Tammy and Tyler will be at home on Wednesday afternoon and will be expecting you whenever they see you.  Meagan has drill team practice after school until 4:45 and she drives herself home and Amanda rides the bus home after school, arriving about 4:30.  Mo will be in Houston while you are here.  If it still works with your plans, I thought that I would take the day off on Friday, November 3 so that you, Paul, David and I could do something fun with Rebecca and Tyler.  The football game is that evening at 7:00.  I had also thought about arranging a lunch on Thursday (downtown - Irma's? ) either for us with Mo, or even to expand that to include a bunch of ex-First City folks.  Mark Wilson, James Scribner, Chuch Randall and Charles Delacey all work here for Enron.  We could call MG Shetty, and with you and Mo and me, it would be quite a reunion.  Let me know if you would like to do either one of these two things and I will arrange whatever sounds good to you.

The following schedule has been distributed as noted regarding publishing the DPR over the next two weeks.  I know that books run in Calgary, Houston, and Portland will be calculated and officialized on Friday, December 22nd for trading that day.  The current plan is not to publish the DPR for December 22nd on Tuesday, December 26th, but to wait until the first Enron official business day to do so (i. e. Wednesday, December 27th).  That will work as long
