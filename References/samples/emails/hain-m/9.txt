 I am uncomfortable taking any further formal action at least until we have a meeting with Sierra on the PGE transaction that was scheduled for this week and may take place next week.    Do we have any idea on what further delay is costing us (i. e. , $__/month)?

Due to Nevada Power's dilatory tactics to date and the pendancy of financing for the project, Ed, Don, Stan, Jim G. , and I agree that the letter takes the necessary tone and should ask Sierra to file with FERC the agreements (unexecuted) if Sierra doesn't give EPMI an executable contracts by 2/28/01.

I left in two paragraphs that are repetitive that relate Stan's conversation with Nevada Power in September.  Stan would you draft these two paragraphs together and make them factully correct?  Thanks. Attached find key provisions of the CTS tariff that may be useful in discussions in the next couple of days. In case you weren't aware.  The call is about joining a FERC filing with PacifiCorp about the PX's recent actions. Please E-mail me and Jim Steffes the document to be discussed on the 11:00 a. m. conference call tomorrow.

I would be interested in going to the discussion too.
