Do we want to help Dynegy or do we want to file our usual letter asking for confidential treatment? I know we are addressing this on the state side.  I was wondering is there= =20 also a FERC angle we should prepare?  Sue and Joe: don't you think we shoul= d=20 submit an RCR to have Ron do some research on the surrounding issues?  Here= =20 are a few that came to mind. (1) What jurisdiction does FERC have over a state-owned transmission system= =20 (especially in light of Order No. 2000 and the governance of the Cal ISO on= =20 file at FERC)? (2) Is there anything FERC can do to stop the conveyance (e. g. , since the= =20 utilities would have to file a Section 203 filing for approval to convey th= e=20 assets, what basis would be available to argue that conveyance was not in t= he=20 public interest. )  Should Joe explore with Hebert the Commission's=20 willingness to fight with the State about this? (3) If the State had the utilities operate the transmission system, subject= =20 to the State's control, would that comply with Order No. 2000? =20 Susan J Mara@ENRON 02/20/2001 01:32 PM To: rcarroll@bracepatt. com, Joe Hartsoe/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sarah=20 Novosel/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Donna Fulton/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Hain/HOU/ECT@= ECT cc: =20 Subject: SBX 33 - Update Comments on the floor in passing SBX 33, which allows the state to buy the= =20 IOUs transmission system.

This sounds like an issue we should be coordinating with the East desk too. Attached find a SoCal Edison filing asking the FERC to require the Cal PX to cease and desist from liquidating or disposing its block forward contracts until FERC does an audit.  It opposes the auction mechanism the PX has proposed for its block forward contracts because it would offer the contracts back to the generators first.  It also claims that the PX could not suspend its day ahead (DA) and day of markets (DO) without a tariff filing.  It asks the FERC to set the day ahead and day of market clearing price at zero. I think we should intervene and challenge the right of first refusal part of the auction and perhaps support the cease and desist until the Commission ensures: (1) that we get a fair opportunity to participate in the auction and (2) that at least fair market value is received in the event we don't succeed in the auction.  Concerning suspending the PX DA and DO markets, I know EES was unhappy about it when it happended but, now that EES has the utilities scheduling for its retail customers, is it too late to do anything about it?
