has been suspeneded, so I created # 316727 under the counterparty of Duke Energy Field Services Marketing, LLC. Hillary - Please extend the CES-Duke counterparty or attach the correct Duke counterparty to this deal. If you have any questions, let me know. D 	 	 When will the buybacks and swings be set up for July?  I am a little concerned with the long weekend coming up.  I believe that we agreed that these would be set up by the 3rd work day, which would be Friday the 7th.  (Six days of flow. )  I definitely don't think that we should any later.  It would be great if this could be handled sooner, miimizing our economic impact. Additionally, we need to get the Industrial spreadsheet up and running again.  This report is very beneficial to Gas Control, industrial traders and schedulers on call. Let me know what you think. We did not sale to Conoco on 5/5/00. D Sitara #139066 has a max of 9500 in the flex nom.  Is this correct?  Should the additional 1500 be on a swing ticket or included on the index ticket? D Deal 93200 covers this meter.  However, we have a zero as the expected volume.  You can select "always send nom" in MOPS to get this to come over in POPS. D Deal 312610 purchase at Centana Deal 312613 Sale at Rusk.

Enron North America Corp. 	 I got in trouble the last time I exposed myself. 	 	 Please go ahead and update Sitara. D In most cases, ENA will be a net buyer from Tenaska IV for activity related to the Cleburne plant.  However, for October 2000, the plant was down the majority of the month and ENA sold off the supply, resulting in ENA owing money to Tenaska IV. I have created deal 529856 with a demand of $1,798,389.73, which is the calculated amount of income on the Cleburne desk. (Please see the attached schedule. )   We need to pass this income on to Tenaska IV.  Do we need to pay this amount (wire from ENA to Tenaska IV) or is there another way to do this?  This is the case for October 2000 and could possibly happen again in the future. Greg, Troy, Jim - Please let me know what you think about settling this. Megan - Don't pay the amount until we here
