not late.  For a couple of 3rd party pipelines, we do use Unify.  But we did not have nom changes for 5/4.  Our only problem was sending noms to HPL.  Which is sending information to yourself, but it still delays the confrimation process for the pipeline.  This nom was sent about 30 minutes late.  Let me know if you have any questions.

Thanks, Kenny Mike, What is the status of the list we compiled a few months ago?  I had a few items on that list, but I can't remember the details now.  Since I don't deal with Unify as much as I used to, the only thing that I can remember is: We need to add a column with the initials of the schedulers responsible for each meter. That's fine Yes, Who is this? I've changed the deal to 1 for the rest of this month and for May. d Go ahead and make those changes. D Craig re-negotiated this deal, begining with April 2000. D 	Enron North America Corp. 	 I will not be in the office on Friday. Done. FYI.  Due to scheduling concerns and contract language, I changed the delivery point on this deal to Eastrans pipeline, instead of HPL.  This should clean up the allocations for this area.  Also, beginning on Nov 15th, we cut the swap to zero, and I purchased the gas at Cotton Valley under a spot agreement (#484935). Let me know if you have any questions. D 	Enron North America Corp. 	 Yes, you can create the deal ticket. D Charlotte, I need you to find out what's going on with this point and the transport on Channel.  Apparantly, we are moving some gas on Channel from HPL #3455 to HPL #6490. (Deals 83084 and 83088).  Why has this occurred each month? D 	 	 March is consistent with Feb.
