any questions. D 	 	 10/17 #439156 9/30 #420864 (This deal is under Samedan) Are there any other days on the invoices? D Bob and Mary, Please talk to Vance Taylor about this. Daren I'll be there.  I mean it this time.  Really. D Name Tags: Daren Farmer Tonya Farmer 	 	 Dave, This should explain the variance with Lubrizol.  We did not get this info. , so Sitara was not adjusted. D We didn't buy anything from Pan Energy at Centana Mobil until April the 3rd.  So, we shouldn't pay for this gas. D See registration form below. Mary, Please get with some one in measurement to check the flows at the meter.  I am thinking that the measurement must be incorrect. In POPS, the estimates vs acutals look odd.  The gas that was coming to us in June, is going to Koch in July, so we should not be receiving anything.  D HOw much does that cost?  I mayh run it through Tom's RC. Finney, Congratulations on the new baby! Are you sure you picked up the right one at the hospital?  She is too cute to have anything to do with you.  Hope everybody is doing good and ya'll are getting at least a little sleep. Daren Nicole, The correct price is 4.50.  I changed the deal ticket. D 	 	 I'll be there.

Enron employees will be leaving at 11:30am on Continental flight #1668 from Bush Intercontinental on Friday 8/4/00. The return flight from Tampa will be Continental #1663 leaving Tampa at 3:20 pm on Sunday, arriving in Houston at 4:29pm. I believe that there are a couple of later flights on Friday (around 1:30 and 3:30) if Gary needs to come in for a part of the day.  I will probably have to catch one of the later ones, but Gary is welcome to go whenever he likes. If you have any questions, give me a call @ 36905. Daren possibly friday.  I will take Mon the 18th off also. Done. D Hillary, Can we extend deal 77352 for the rest of the year?  I tried to do this, but
