I've attached a survey to help us collect the data that will be driving your costs from the activities to the commercial teams.  In the 'Data' tab, please select the your RCs, and fill in the driver quantity for the requested driver for the month of February. Please fill out the attached activity driver survey with March numbers for your RC by end of day Wednesday, April 5th.  If your group currently generates a standard report that captures the surveyed data, please send the report to me, and put me on your recipient list beginning next month.  This will eliminate your need to fill out this survey every month.  If you would like us to collect this information from someone within your team beginning next month, please let me know.  Please take this opportunity to verify the following: 1. The driver indicates a measure for the time and effort your team spent to perform these activities for each commercial team. 2. The activity is spent in support of the commercial teams identified (please let us know otherwise) 3. If the activity is using an allocation (for example "Allocate 0469" or "80-20 Split"), that the percentage allocated to each commercial team has not changed from last month.   (Please let us know if it has changed what the new allocation is). In reference to these surveys, please note: If you are allocating only infrastructure costs to some commercial teams listed in the survey, please identify them.  We will take your business support costs (such as feedback, training, etc. ) and allocate them evenly among these teams. The costs for "commercial team specific" activities that you filled time out for in the January time survey will be directly allocated to that commercial team (e. g. Genco Support will trace 100% of its costs to Genco).  Please let us know if you have any questions on this survey.
