Let me know if you want to play again in the next season. This transport ticket should have been entered under ENA, instead of HPL.  However, the pathing in Unify is correct.  HPL sold 30,000 on th 15th to ENA, who then transported it to mtr 628 on Oasis for .015. Daren 	Enron North America Corp. 	 Which direction should I go on 610? I'll be there. Just a little explanation on what you're seeing. We have a swing deal at this point with Equistar, which allows them to take excess volumes over the base nom.  We have been estimating the overtakes each day at 15, 000.  However, because of limitations of the scheduling system, we can't nom the volumes estimated on the swing deal.  So, Equistar is within their rights and I am monitoring their activity, but the nom versus actual doesn't reflect this.  This occurs with a few of our industrial points. D 	Enron North America Corp. 	 The new fixed price deal with Equistar is #365013. D Melissa, I show that we also had 20.000 at LS HPL for the 13th.
