get over on someone as badly as matt got over on you.  so you might as well bite the bullet and make a trade that actually is good for your team how about the final pick in the 2nd and my third for your 2nd and your 4th my 2 and 11 what do you want for it? How do I go about getting my logon id and password?  I seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out. Thanks, Eric Bass x30977 How do I go about getting my logon id and password?  I seem to have deleted the e-mail that was sent out. Thanks, Eric Bass x30977 can't do it , but i am willing to do my 4 and 7 for your 2 alright, how about my 4 and 7 for your 2 no ican't do that. how about my 4 and 7 for your 2 I will be at the dinner on Thursday. Thanks, Eric 	 	 in order to counter offer, you must have had an offer.  if you remember, you offered me a lesser trade than that already my counter offer is 4,7,10 for your 2, 8 By popular vote, we will not redraw.  Our draft will take place, this Sunday at 11:45 am at BW-3 in Rice Village. he probably doesn't want to redraw because he knows he can't possibly rip you off any more than he already has!

I wonder why Lenhart doesn't want to redraw?  Are you afraid you will not be able to score the #1 pick again? PL did you buy enron this morning? I am taking a vote on if we need to redraw the draft order.  Some, have said that it is not fair for Steve to be handed the 6th slot.  Let me know what you think. -Eric thanks, again, for calling me back last night! Brian, Hector, and Lenny have dropped out (what a shocker).
