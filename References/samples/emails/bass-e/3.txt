is the same as before, but are interested after this week's action? Ricky and Warrick for Carter and Smith? sorry if we do around 80 i got a second room but don't know if we will keep it if we dont - around 54 if we do around 60 you better shape or other players are going to jump ship to the mullets.  i am noticing a recurring theme here in our fantasy leagues - first the gangsta and now marcus. Marcus Robinson was just telling me how much he likes his new digs compared to TKC.  He loves Tijuana.  What kind of show are you running over there? - THE MULLETS you have to like garcia against carolina over brunell against balt or bledsoe against njy . . .  don't you? How about Garcia and Bettis for Brunell? So this is how it will work.  Whenever the payment is due (the 18th).  You write me a check for $100.  I will pay the $1252.  You will pay me $100/ month for 13 months ( so you last payment will be made to me on October 18th, 2001). Payments will be due to me on the 18th of every month - NO EXCEPTIONS -  I cannot do this deal if you do not pay me on time - I will not make any exceptions for you. Let me know if this is ok with you and I will work up a contract. -Eric Brian Hoskins/HOU/ECT Luis Mena/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT Amir Ahanchian/HOU/ECT Matthew Lenhart/HOU/ECT Timothy Blanchard/HOU/EES Bryan Hull/HOU/ECT Jeffrey C Gossett/HOU/ECT O'Neal D Winfree/HOU/ECT David Baumbach/HOU/ECT Kenneth Shulklapper/HOU/ECT Nick Hiemstra/HOU/ECT I need for you to find out how much the balance on your tv is - and let me know Brunell or Bledsoe - which one are you willing to trade and for what?
