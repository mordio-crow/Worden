We are going to have the draft on 8/20.  However, we still need to decide where and at what time.  I would prefer to have the draft around noon.  We can have the draft at a bar (BW-3) or at the enron building (access to the internet).  Please let me know ASAP. -Eric it doesn't look good for austin, how is your aunt? have you started building your model yet?
