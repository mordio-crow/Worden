keep the ball rolling here with or without him. Mat Oh, I had fun as well.  I'm glad you guys came.  Unfortunately the rest of the week was not great, but Jeffrey and I met some ladies friday night and at about 2 am we all decided to head to Louisiana to gamble!  It's a great story!  I went flying on Sunday too which was nice.  Give me a call if you want to chat sometime.

Hey, I just wanted to write to say thanks for the fun while we were in Houston and the week in general, but mostly for taking care of my drunk, annoying ass at the airport.  I think I was still a little looped the next morning.  Totally sorry if that turned into a big babysitting job for you! ! ! So, did you have a fantastic weekend after we left?  How did you avoid the freaks?  love, k _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer. msn. com Tom, I took a few days off and just got back. . . . Anyway, I haven't tried it without the key, but if you say it works, then I'm sure it does.  One thing I'm realizing, though, is that it's taking me way too much time to babysit this thing through multiple runs of the model even when it does work.  In order to get the full benefit of your model I want to run it a zillion times for many different combinations of parameters.  So, if you haven't guessed already, I'm wondering how hard it would be to get this thing to zip through some preset combinations of parameters and save the results without me tending to it.  I envision a spreadsheet where I list out all of the parameter values for each run, and the model picks out the parameters, runs through a year's worth of data, and saves the summary sheet, then steps to the next set of variables.  In this way I could set it to run a bunch of times over night or something so it wouldn't tie up the work day.  Would this be just a separate macro?  What do you think?

The problems with our network licence for the solver have gone away - I do not really understand what happened.  Try the model aand see if it works OK - runs fine on my computer now, whereas it did not run 2 weeks ago.  I suspect some sort of network problem, and IT have not been able to figure out any more likely cause. Tom Tom, Sounds fine anytime is good.  Basically the parameters that need changing are those on the Optimizer sheet: Start/End Date Spreads
