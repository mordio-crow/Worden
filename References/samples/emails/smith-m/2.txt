I have not gotten the place yet, since I was waiting for you to tell me that they are on their way.  Since I have not heard from you, I'm assuming they are not. . . . so what's up?  I still need everyone's email because I don't not have those original messages with everyones address on them.  I think it would be great if everyone who's commited could send me an email just saying when they plan on paying. . . I guess it's really only your friend and Duncan's friend, so I guess it's not really a big deal.  I don't know, I guess I just don't have a warm fuzzy feeling because you're the only person I speak to and I often times have trouble getting in touch with you, which by the way, you never did reply to my email asking how often you read you email so I know whether I should use it to get in touch with you. Anyway, I just got back from NYC. . . had a great time, except for the fact that Scully feels the need to build a wall between us.  I can deal, but its just kind of annoying.  I just feel the need to put this skiing thing to bed quickly.

We have our six and can add on others as they fill in, but I'm done waiting for people to get back to me! ! ! ! Did you get my card yet? Can't wait! ! ! The snow was heavy on Sunday but what a great time! ! !   Last night I took a lesson and we hit the moguls (or as those "in the know" refer to them as, "the bumps").  What a rush.  My ski's are a tad long for me (180's) and so it was tough at first but about three runs into it I started feeling the rhythm and that was it. . . . total addiction! ! So what's going on? ? ? love, k _________________________________________________________________ Get your FREE download of MSN Explorer at http://explorer. msn. com Oh yes, I had a good time, although very exhausted from getting in late.  Did you have a good weekend?  Hand out with Marky much?  I noticed some of my wine stash was depleted.  Did you have anything to do with that?  Mat "Salazar, Alexis" <ASalazar@PIRNIE.
