February 20, in EB38C2. Thank you. Janette Elbertson Enron North America Corp. Legal Department - EB3326 Telephone:  (713) 853-7906 Fax:  (713) 646-2600 janette. elbertson@enron. com Peter, I learned yesterday for the first time about Project Canary, which involves the purchase of an asset that employs 400 employees and also has a unionized workforce.  I understand that we are in the second round, and that there is a deadline of 12/15. Peter, we have discussed on numerous occasions the need for you to get me involved early whenever there are transactions involving personnel issues.  You haven't involved me in this deal -- I learned about the fact that there are employees and unions from my clients in HR.  That makes me and the legal department look bad and also does not allow me to provide the best service for Enron. Please provide me with information about this deal asap.  And, I repeat my request to get me involved earlier on future deals. Thank you.

Where: Beech Street *~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~*~* I set up a meeting with Gillette Burns to talk about financial planning stuff.  Will this time work for you? Thanks for the info.  I just need simple, basic frames.  No decorations or anything.  That way, they can go anywhere, and aren't specific to a decor, theme, time of year, etc.  So, painted wood or black resin probably are the best.  I could use 5x7" the most. Trey is going to get Playstation 2 once they become available, so you may want to find a game for the new machine.  Also, since it has a DVD player attached, he will need DVDs to play on it.  I already got him Being John Malkovich and the Grinch, but he has no others. We are looking forward to your visit.  Trey, Cameron and I are going to the Nutcracker ballet on the 26th.  Do you and Marianne want to go?  I am sure that Kay would love to watch Madison, and I would think that we still could get tickets if you are interested.  Let me know. See you later.
