-- with the notes?  Thanks.  MHC 12/18 is ok, not the 19th. __________________ I am afraid that my prior e-mail to you may not have reached you, because I had a little trouble with my e-mail delivery last week.  Either day is fine with me, so you choose.  And not to worry about the 31st. Linda Hi, Kelly, Yes, I probably am the person to contact on this.  In fact, I am getting ready to circulate a draft data protection policy that would put Enron in compliance with EU directives.  Look for it in the next few days! Michelle 	Kelly Noel Higgason@ENRON Hi, Linda.   I am not surprised; she sent me an email, too.  I was out on vacation last week, so I only gave Kim my feedback early this week.  I hope that ELM has received the response by now.  Let me know if I need to do anything else.

She believes that she will most likely move to Philadelphia with her mother instead of pursuing other opportunities for re-hire at Enron. hgm __________________ Oops!  The location for the welcome coffee is EB38C2. See you there! Don't worry about it!  Of all people, I understand about schedules being tight.  Good luck with the post-trial work.  Michelle 	"Eden Sholeen" <esholeen@bracepatt. com> I am available at 3:00 Wednesday.  I agree that we should convene and discuss.  I would be surprised if we have grounds to challenge, but we can keep our fingers crossed.  If we don't, then we could discuss strategy for negotiations.  Thanks.

He will be at the facility Wednesday morning and will have a report about what happened Friday and the possible grounds for an election challenge. I think this is a good idea,  Is it ok with you?  If so, is the time convenient? ---- This email may contain confidential and privileged material for the sole use of the intended recipient(s).
