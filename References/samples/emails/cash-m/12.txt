Thanks, Alan 	George McClellan I don't know anything about this!  MC 	Richard B Sanders Jim/Don, Do you know anything about this for Ecogas? Michelle Cash Kerry,  What are your thoughts on this issue? Michelle Michelle, We have had a couple of interpretations as to how to calculate the overtime for employees who receive a shift differential and wanted to ask for assistance from you.  The problem we are having deals with employees who rotate shift.  Please review the following scenario. For a simple example with an ee at $10/hour and shift of $1/hour for the Night (N) shift. M T W Th F S REG  8 8 8 8 8 OT       8 SHIFT  N N D D D D Interpretation 1 The shift differential would be added to his pay to determine the regular rate of pay and his pay would be calculated as follows: REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    124.80  ((400+16)/40) x 1.5) Interpretation 2 Since his overtime was during a day shift, his pay would be calculated as follows: REG  $400 SHIFT       16 OT    120.00 (400/40 x 1.5) Can you please let us know which interpretation is correct or if we have totally missed the boat on both of them? Thanks for your help, Diane David,  I am with you.  In fact, I sent this issue to outside counsel earlier this week because I simply wasn't able to get to it due to the issues surrounding the latest reorg/redeployment efforts.  I expect an answer by Monday or Tuesday.  Sorry I forgot to let you know about the status.  Michelle 	David O'Dell@ENRON Twanda, could you please handle this if you haven't already?  Thanks!  M Here is his form b date.  mhc Twanda, please print.  Thanks.  MHC Gerry, should Sharon Butcher and Kriste Sullivan be included in the distribution list?  I would think so, now that we are back to "normal" staff meetings.
