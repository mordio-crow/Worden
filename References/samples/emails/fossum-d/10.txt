 I. e. , on that type of deal, we can determine that the index mechanism is worth "x cents" to us and require a discounted recourse rate bidder to bid more than the floor plus x cents to win.  Agreed?  Note that NGPL whined that the unique rules they are subject to place them at a competitve disadvantage to the rest of the industry (i. e. , us) on this issue.  The commission didn't say anything about that, implying to me that the rest of us are still free to do what NGPL cannot do.   DF  I suspect that the answer lies in Mary Kay Miller's or Julia White's areas, or both.  Mary Kay and Julia, who is the best person to go to to find the monthly sales MDQ from 88 through the end of the merchant service?  I suspect that Glen or Bob could point us toward the monthly aggregate purchase data during that same period (Britt--wasn't this was provided in discovery prior to the first trial? ).

DF pls give that copy of Gorak's sba filing to maria.  I think I left it with you and Mary.  df Randy, this is the issue I left you the voice mail on.  Article 6 of the Gallup Compression Services Agreement (which I am sending to you separately) with ECS obligates ECS to "work in good faith with CDEC" to establish an automated system that would automatically have alerted us to peak loading conditions on CDEC's system.
