 I swore Sinclair to secrecy and told him what part of the world I was interested in and he thought we could probably stitch together private ROW without too much pain.  If the RR option doesn't pan out, we may want to suggest to Tino and Dennis that our ROW people can handle this.  Assuming we can't come up with some magic contact with the RR, I propose that, at the appropriate time,  we tell Dennis and Tino that the last 7 or 8 miles of ROW should be flagged as a potential problem that Enron can help resolve once we decide to go forward.   Other than the BNSF issue, I don't think we have any specific "to dos" or any specific comeback date to Dennis and Tino.  So what do you guys think should happen next?  DF What a mess.  Keeping discovery at bay should, obviously, continue to be a very high priority for us.  Let me know if these strange events signal an increased likelihood that Gynberg will be able to pursue discovery.

If so, will it be at 8:30 or can it be 9:00 am? --Dot Susan's draft has inspired me to vent months worth of frustration at the Commission.  To save Susan from trying to translate my weird scribbles, I'm having Martha type up my vitriol.  Please hold off on detailed comments on Susan's draft unless you've already finished them.  I'll circulate a revised draft to you all later today.  In the mean time, Susan and Frank and Steve, are there not some cases in which the Commission has specifically granted confidential treatment of precedent agreements or discount agreements in expansion cases.  I know the bulk of authority is against us, but I seem to recall at least a few stray decisions where the Commission granted confid. treatment (even if only for a limited time).  Lets talk.  Thanks. DF 	 	 Lindy, if all FERC wanted is  a list and contacts, this looks fine.  If they wanted exact MDQ and usage numbers for each customer, let me know.  DF  	 	 When you guys settle on a name for NewCo, please let me know and also call Lillian Bailey at Corp.  Her # is 33577.  Thanks. df Thanks for
