Great--Steve, what's your phone no. ?  The operator didn't have it and I'd like to talk for a few minutes on this.  Thanks.

Looking at a 10 year deal, there is no way to recoup this value and ENA would not be willing to take the back 10 years on its books without an offtaker.  If EES or DOE were willing to step up for 20 years, there might be an opportunity.   Assuming a 9700 heat rate, $3 per MWh O&M, and NYMEX plus $0.39 for gas, the spread option for a peaker at 4 Corners would be worth between $33 m and $47 m.  The first number represents the intrinsic value, and the second is inclusive of an option premium.  ENA's desk (EPMI) would pay somewhere in between.  Having just inquired with the desk regarding their appetite for taking positions (short 65 MW, long 80 MW) in Albuquerque, they were luke warm.  Considering transmission constraints into Albuquerque, their bid offer spread might run the range of the extrinsic value on the 65 MW load.  Depending on site conditions (available infrastructure), a barebones LM6000 plant could make economic sense.  The plant host would likely need to pay some sort of premium for generation reliability.  EES could sell fixed priced energy with a reliability premium to the DOE.  ENA would back-to-back the EES contract, managing market price risk and economically optimizing the peaker.   As a stand-alone market play, a peaker is marginal at best.  By receiving value for reliability, the project might have merit.  Based on the thin margins, I am skeptical that we would want to build a plant larger than the host's load. . . that is more MW than that amount on which we could expect to receive some sort of demand charge.  Ultimately, the demand charge needs to make up the shortfall between EPMI's swap value and the cost of the plant. Steve 	Enron North America Corp. 	 Great.  The footnote issue scares me.   If we just use the same footnotes as a matter of convenience, we may have some flexibility.  DF 	 	 Excellent!  I hope Briden's project attracts fewer vultures than Dennis Langley's.  I need to go to Midland on the afternoon of the 12th, so could meet in Houston conveniently on the morning of the 12th or anytime 10 am or later on the 11th.  I could meet on the 10 th after 10, but less conveniently.  Just let Martha know what the plan is and she'll deploy me.  Also,  when you say they want TW to "build, own and operate the plant" you mean the gas pipeline
