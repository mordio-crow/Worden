of GTC attached to the physical online power confirms and was going to be sending me a letter requesting certain revisions.  He said the letter would come from Francine Matthews at VEPCO.  I looked this counterparty up in my database, and it appears that we approved them to trade physical power with an override letter.  Usually, we don't allow any changes to the online GTC, but with physical power & the override letters, I know there is some wiggle room.  I don't know how you want to handle this, if you want to wait for the letter from VEPCO to come in and then deal with the issues, or head him off at the pass.  Just let me know. I am going to run w/holly at 7:00 on saturday and then meet her for breakfast at 8 at the IHOP.  Lucinda is going to join us for breakfast.  I thought maybe if it met w/your running schedule you might want to join us. . . I will be out Friday afternoon and Monday afternoon for my termite and house inspections for my new house. Holly & I are going running Saturday at 7, then meeting Lucinda for breakfast at the IHOP at 8.  Do you want to join us? Done.

The two descriptions in red text are existing product types in Enron Online.  In each other description, the text you see in blue is the only portion that changes in the product type description from commodity to commodity.  As the product types are created in the Enron Online Production database, your approval will be requested.  The purpose of this email is to provide you with advance notice so the approval process can be executed quickly.  Please contact me with questions or concerns. Thank you.
