this under the Houston master with Hess Energy Trading Company LLC.  	Julie Brewer@ENRON At the request of Bob Shults, I am attaching our proposed form of Letter of Interest.   This LOI has been revised to cover US crude, refined products and coal and emissions.  If the enclosed meets with your approval, please execute the agreement and return it to me via fax no. (713) 646-3490.  I will then have it executed by Enron Net Works.  If you have any comments or questions please call Mark Greenberg, Senior Counsel, at (713) 345-8897 or Bob at (713) 853-0397. Attached is the list reflecting the approval of the initial Australian counterparties to trade Australian financial power only.  David Minns will have to get back to us about all the other products! For the current U. S. list of counterparties, just mirror the approvals for "US Power Financial Swaps". I will review the list Debbie is sending me tomorrow to see if any of her approvals conflicts with my earlier approvals, but I think we should be fine. That was pretty good! 	Keegan Farrell@ENRON He can call any one of the attorneys in the Swap Group, Mary Cook does Canada, but she'll be out next week so it would have to be quick, or Sara Shackleton or Brent Hendry. 	Veronica Gonzalez/ENRON@enronXgate Jennifer, If you're still there give me a call in calgary about this, I'm at 403/974-6745.

Tana, Please let me know if you need any other information in order to create the documentation neccessary. Thank you for your help. Jennifer 3-5824 At the request of Liz Sager, I am attaching our language with respect our transfer: Do you want a bilateral or one-way, and what is the nature of your discussions? 	Daniel Diamond The above counterparty on the 3/7/01 list is ID#93394.  We had a counterparty on the pre-approval list that was called International Paper Company and was ID#1836.  Was that one in error?  Are they the same, different?  What's the scoop? Thanks for your help! Sam, I think counterparty ID# 754 is Bonneville Power Administration, not Bonneville Power Association.
