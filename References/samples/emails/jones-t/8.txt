for getting these approved?  Mark Taylor is out all weekend, and if it can't wait I'll get another lawyer to look at it. Please find attached referenced lists.  It is not clear to me yet how we are going to deal with Australian approvals, so I think at this point you need to look to Australia for approval of their counterparties.  Also, there were no counterparties to approve on 3/16/00 so that list is not attached. I haven't said it in a while. . . but no European power for US counterparties. . . Just a note in case some of the product abbreviations on the NYMEX calendar don't make sense, they have what the abbreviations mean at the back of the calendar. Mark, I discussed this issue Friday with Paul, however, since it is an issue I am not entirely knowledgeable about, I think Paul should run this by you. . . I just did a request to get Angela Davis in the Houston Office and Linda Sietzema and Sharon Crawford in the Calgary offices edit access to the Financial Trading Agreement Database.  I also requested that Marcus Nettelton get edit access to the ENA Legal Online Trading Database.  I'm not sure if I did the "erequest" all ok.  Can you check to make sure your got all four?  Thanks! 	Enron Messaging Security@ENRON If you have time to attend, please join us. . . Mike, I attempted to give Edmund Manager access by doing one of those security requests today.  I don't know if you need to do anything or not here. . . . I'll come pick you up.  	Mark Powell Is there an Icon I can send to Marcus to get into the ENA Legal Online Database. Can someone call me at x33399.  I'm in the middle of doing these again and it won't let me submit the form. 	Enron Messaging Security@ENRON Good memo Peter.  Is it OK if I forward this to the Credit Team so they also know how this process will work?

Attached are the Canadian forms as they currently stand.  All of our forms are currently under revision, so there may be some more changes coming out soon. Lou, I left Mark Tawney a voicemail to call me re: the ISDA sample form.  I'll need to know a little bit more about the company so I send them the right form. In order to complete your access request, I need your company number and your 6 digit sap cost center code. Are these physical transactions? 	Kimberly Hundl@ENRON OK by me!
