people I always struggled for a way to ask these type of questions legally and ethically.  I think the packet also will aid in my organization and will keep the interview moving at an efficient pace. Thanks, Errol McLaughlin Jeff, For a long time John and Mike have been letting counterparties who accidentally click on the Gas Daily stack change the deals to NYMEX swaps.  The counterparty would let John/Mike know and then they would tell us.  In addition, at the end of the month, we would get calls from settlements and credit telling us (per the counterparty) that there were more deals that needed to be changed from GD to Nymex than we had changed.  John would let them change those deals too. On Friday we changed some Jan. `01deals with Utilicorp that had been done in late November to NYMEX swaps.  Because of the timing there was a P/L impact of -$1.3MM.  When John saw this today he asked me what it was, I explained, and he stated that what they click on is what they get.  I relayed this to settlements and credit and that is why Kim is calling you b/c Reliant and Utilicorp are 'upset'.  They claim that they have John and Mike on tape letting them out of the GD deals and into NYMEX swaps. We do not change the actual deals booked by EOL.  We book two new legs that create a NYMEX swap and flip out the GD deal. Errol Yes this is correct.  This is the reason Sherry and Amy have to flip out deals everyday.  EOL is only booking them to one leg. Thanks, Errol The deals below were changed tonight per John Arnold.

TAGG is showing these deals as Gas Daily, but the counterparty states that they should be changed to Nymex trades. They also stated that they were told by Mike Maggi that the deals would be changed to Nymex deals: Greg, Deal QD 8473 is not a Reliant deal, nor is it an EOL Gas Daily swap.  Deal QE 7484 was changed to a NYMEX swap today and QE 9432 was changed on 01/04/2001.

Could you let me know when it is changed? Thanks! ! ! Sharon,
