Dutch is on vacation and I have left him a voicemail asking if he's is interested.  I will give you a call a little later in the day when things settle down. Thanks, Errol McLaughlin Homer, I just left you a voicemail regarding the natsource study.  We have been able to pull in the basis and price curves, but we are having trouble getting the gas daily curves for June to come in correctly.  I. T. is looking into this issue and will have us an answer soon.  Email me and let me know where I can save a file out to you with the curves we do have.  The file is too large to Email. Thank you, Errol McLaughlin, X5-8274 Done. EM 	 	 Jim, Thanks a lot for great basket - I just got it.  We'll call on Monday.

Thanks, Vikas I finally got through to your fax at 11:00 am Houston time.  Please call me at 713-345-8274 if you have any questions. Thanks, Errol McLaughlin Agustin, Per our discussion on Friday, I have changed this deal so that Enron is selling leg 1.  I can't remember.  Did you say that we have already received a check back from the counterparty?  Let me know, b/c this deal has price and basis and I'm sure the desk that had the basis risk wants the money owed them.
