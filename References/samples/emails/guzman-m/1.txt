to take advantage of a good fare so please let me know if there is a problem by then.  Thanks.  Hey Dave,  that sounds good to me.  I will see what days I have off of work and get back to you tommorow night but I was planning on coming down for it all along.  Like i said i well let you know tommorow. Hope all is well. mark fyi,  opening day for the dodgers is Monday, April 2nd against Milwaukee. It's a 1:00 day game.     The girls happen to have a four day weekend that week and they are coming down for Karen's shower on Saturday. . . . . .   so, I was planning on booking tickets for us on that day. Let me know if you are interested and I will book you a ticket. . . or more if you want extra.     Field box seats are $17 in the outfields,  so  I'll probably just book those instead of getting scalper tickets. dave ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ ----------------------- The information transmitted is intended only for the person or entity to which it is addressed and may contain confidential and/or privileged material.
