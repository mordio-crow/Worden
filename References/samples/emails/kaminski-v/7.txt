America Corp. 	 Nadene, 713 853 3848. My secretary's number is 713 853 5290. Her name is Shirley Crenshaw. Vince Tom, I got sick and had to reschedule the meeting with Nick Bambos. I shall meet him on Saturday this week. I shall talk to him about the following: 1. Financing research projects by graduate students ($100K per year, spread over several projects) 2. Inviting Nick to visit Enron 3. I can mention the possibility of Nick consulting for us. Given his status, involvement in the Internet2 project, and views that closely parallel Enron's vision, it makes sense to have him working for us. He could be a very effective voice supporting our initiatives. Please, let me know what you think. Vince Robert, This is to confirm the meeting on March the 20th at 9:00 a. m. Enron will be represented by Bill Bradford, Bryan Seyfried,,Vasant Shanbhogue and myself. Could you, please, advise me what is the best hotel where we could stay overnight, close to your location?
