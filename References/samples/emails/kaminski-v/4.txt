Brad will not show up on March 15. He is still working on his dot-com business and wants to pursue this opportunity. 2. My recommendation is that we should draw a line in the sand. Either Brad or a stipend refund check should show up on March 15. 3. I told Brad that  a failure to show up on March 15 will not imperil his future employment opportunities with Enron. We just need clarity and ability to plan our human resource needs. If he decides to re-apply at some point in the future, we shall not hold his  decision  to pursue him entrepreneurial plans against him. Please, let me  know what you think. Vince Ravi, The proposed dates work for me. Vince Ravi, It's fine with me. I think the expense is justified (as it's equal to the cost of the alternative). Vince Fati, Please contact Krishnarao Pinnamaneni or Osman Sezgen. Vince Celeste, We shall match the tuition cost. We are very anxious to have Gappy here at Enron supporting EBS. Vince Shirley, No problem. Vince Madre, Thanks for your message. I was at the meetings all the time. Vince Paige, In this case I shall ask Stinson and Zimin to talk to you next week. I am going to prepare and send you an  outline of a document we can produce on defining and testing hedging effectiveness. Vince Thanks for the message. I am traveling on the days when you offer the class. Please, keep me in mind. Vince Paige, This is when I am in NYC. What about Friday this week? Vince Tracy, Confirming the meeting tomorrow, Thursday,  1:30p. m. Vince Kaminski $933  to Dean Witter Shirley, Please, enroll me in this course. Vince Tony, Great.
