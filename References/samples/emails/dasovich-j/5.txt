the participants list---are advocates of a minimalist role for government, particularly where markets are a clear and preferably option, as in the case of electricity.  That said, I think we're going to have to make a fundamental decision about what the goal of this "study" would be, which will determine, to a large degree, whether we choose to pursue it.  I'll throw out for comment the notion that the study should be designed to serve one purpose:  to influence the policy decision currently under debate "To de-regulate or not. "  As such, I wouldn't see issues like "PJM or APX" or "competitive default supplier or not," or "divest generation with vesting contracts or retain the assets" being the focus.  That debate over critically important implementation details, would seem to come in "Round 2," once the initial debate over "deregulate or not" is won.  To try to do both, i. e. , resolve in the broad policy issue AND make the case for the specific, "right" implementation plan, would arguably bog the study down, perhaps interminably.  And it seems that time is of the essence in the current environment.  In addition, unless the fundamental policy issue is won--and won rather quickly--debating  implementation may be moot.  Of course, it will be impossible to avoid some level of dicussion on "how to do it," but that would not be the emphasis. In sum, I'd suggest for comment that it only makes sense to proceed---particularly since time is of the essence---if we focus on the high level policy level question of "to deregulate or not," and address implementation in a second, or follow up, study.  I think we should try to make a call on this swiftly, since the "go/no go" decision would seem to flow from resolution of this issue.

I would like to know Teece's perspective on the role of government in this marketplace.  In addition, I think that the paper must deal with the drawbacks of having mixed roles - utility default supply and competitive markets.

Clearly, we're at a fork in the policy road---move forward, or go back.  I've (finally) gotten a proposal from the group.  It's attached.
