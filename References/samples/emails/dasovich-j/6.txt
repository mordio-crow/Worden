 Please take a look.  I'd like to distribute more widely internally for comment, but wanted to run it through a preliminary screen to guage whether folks think it would be useful before cluttering up folks' in-boxes with more emails to read.  Few points worth mentioning: The majority of the academics that would do the report are affiliated with LECG, Inc. , the consulting group that I worked with prior to joing Enron.  List also includes Dan McFadden, UC Berkeley nobel prize winner who wrote the recent op-ed piece in the WSJ. The list also includes Hogan and Joskow  and Borenstein.  We could certainly exclude these folks should we choose to go forward with the analysis.  However, the goal is to produce a high level analysis, i. e. , "de-regulation is good and can work; command and control regulation is bad and we know that it does not work. "  Once the study is released (if it is pursued), the "authors" could tour the country, testifying before federal and state bodies to advocate the virtues of de-regulation and the pitfalls of reversing course.  The analysis would not be a debate over "To Poolco, or not to Poolco, PJM, etc. "  In this way, including folks like Joskow and Hogan could offer the added benefit of creating a "Nixon goes to China" scenario.  Please take a look at the list of participants.  Again, we can add to and subtract from the list. Laura Tyson would be one of the two project leaders. (The other would be David Teece, Chairman of LECG. ) None of the folks on the list occupies either extreme of the political spectrum.  It's a mix of D's and R's who are arguably centrist economist and strong believers in markets (I won't vouch for Joskow and Hogan). The idea would be to get a wide array of industry participants from across the country to support the project.  This is for two reasons:  1) the more diverse the group supporting the effort, the greater the credibility, and 2) they are asking for about $1 million to do the study. If you think it would be useful to pursue the study as part of our national campaign to minimize the damage created by California, I would like to start immediately to approach trade associations, companies, customers, etc. nationwide to garner support for the project. Let me know if you think the effort would be worthwhile.  Appreciate your comments. Best, Jeff Here are some more prices.  Many thanks to Roger Yang.
