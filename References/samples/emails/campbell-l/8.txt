6, 1999. Remember, the state has given us until May 19 to have the rolling emissions calculations completed for both turbines at the facility. A records review training was given to the Carlsbad Team.   Files were established and purged of historic and non applicable documents. A check in the amount of $5,250.00 was delivered to the TNRCC for the late annual certifications required under the Title V air permit program. All dehys in Albuquerque region were entered into the GRI GLYCALC software to determine applicability to the O&G MACT standard.  Preliminary determinations indicate that no dehys will not be subject to the  new rule. An inspection was conducted of the Transwestern Pipeline Keystone C/S landfarm by the Railroad Commission of Texas.  The inspection went well and no deficiencies ro violations were identified by the agency. Title V air permit for the two Arizona C/S's (Leupp and Klagetoh) which are on the Navajo Indian reservation were issued by the USEPA.  The permits seem to be very lenient in terms of requirements.  Meetings have been scheduled with each field team to assign roles and responsibilities to ensure complaince with each permit. George/Norm because there is no immediate concern or liability with the partially filled excavation, I want us wait for the official letter from the tribe before taking it upon ourselves to fill the excavation.  I dont want to send  a message to the Lagunas about us taking environmental matters into our own hands without involvement from the tribe.  If there is a reason to expidite the covering of this open area, then lets  send another  letter requesting to do so.  Given the other issues yet to be resolved at the station, lets keep the tribe involved and a part of our environmental activities.  I want to maintain a good working relationship with these people.  As you may remember, they were a little irritated by Transwestern's neglect of not keeping them in the loop previously.  Lets not open that type of issue again. . . . . .

A closure report was submitted to Ms. Bernacik of the Laguna Pueblo Environmental Department in January. We have not received a formal response from the Pueblo yet, but in a phone conversation, Ms. Bernacik indicated that they would have to take a closer look at the report before making a decision. Regardless, I don't think we need to wait on an approval of the closure report before backfilling the excavation. Thanks, George will do. . . .
