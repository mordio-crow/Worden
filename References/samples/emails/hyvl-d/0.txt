If you have any questions, or unable to attend this meeting, please let me know.   Regards, Dena 3-5073 Sandi, As you know, I am out of the loop relating to the assignment issue.  I believe that George Weismann needs to give us an updated list of contracts that currently exist together with a list of contracts that need to be put in place to match the ENA contracts that ENA now intends to keep, but HPL also wants.  The assignment issue has gotten very complicated.  I think that ENA wants us to enter into new contracts with the counterparties.  I do not think that there are any ENA contracts which need to be assigned to HPL.  There are certain contracts that need to be assigned to the new HPL marketing company, these being the contracts with Entex, etc. , after we decide how ENA also wants to keep the right to do business with these entities.  We probably need a meeting with George to get updated information on what needs to be done. 	Sandi M Braband A GISB can be used for deals longer than a month if they are fully interruptible.  However, we would only use the GISB for firm business If they limit their business to one month or less which would include a 31 day month.   The $20MM credit line represents the mark-to-market exposure of all business that ENA would be doing with the customer so that any deal that would tend to exceed the aggregate credit line would need to be separately supported with additional credit documentation, i. e. , a letter of credit or a increase in the coverage under a parent guarantee.
