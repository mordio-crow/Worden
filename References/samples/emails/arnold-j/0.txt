Bubbie: You are hereby invited to the tenth annual Spectron/Enron Celebrity Tony's dinner featuring Brian Tracy, John Arnold, and Mike Maggi. Regrets only, John please schedule a round of interviews with john griffith with scott, hunter, phillip, and tom asap (today if possible). thx what's this about? John: I would like for you to come talk to a couple more people on the gas floor about a possible position down the road.  My assistant Ina Rangle is going to schedule a couple interviews.  Please coordinate with her. John I want John to interview with the various desk heads (Scott, Hunter, Phillip, Tom).  I think I'm going to tell John not to mention the past.   It's an issue that doesn't need to be made public and as long as Lavo and myself are okay with it, I don't see the need to get individual approval from everyone.  Thanks for your help, John greg: what is the (correct) formula you devised for profitability on last trade is mid? glad you enjoyed yourself even though you didnt get to go to ny.   maybe next year.  Had a great time in new orleans but it was freezing.  nice to get away.  going to vegas this weekend to watch the football games. love you, john are you free for a drink/dinner Wednesday night?  Ed: I am starting options on EOL in about two weeks.  As we discussed earlier, I don't have the appropriate manpower to run this in certain circumstances, such as when I'm out of the office.  As such, I'd like to bring in John Griffith for anohter round of interviews for an options trading role with your permission.  John He joined the group 2 weeks ago.
