Address Book In our efforts to plan the exact date/time of your migration, we also will need to know: What are your normal work hours?  From:8:00am      To:6:30pm Will you be out of the office in the near future for vacation, leave, etc? If so, when?        From 05/17/01      To 05/18/01 We are updating the pricing today.  I'll let you know when it's finished. DG I changed the deal to $14,028 DG We granted a total of $320K ($220K to you and $100K to credit reserve) by mistake.  We will take the extra $100K in orig from you tonight.  I appologize for the error. DG No, I sent the email to you by mistake.  We will be at Sheri's tomorrow.  How do you know her?  Is it through Dawn?  When Sheri sent the message to everyone, I noticed your name on the list and called to ask, but you didn't pick up, and I didn't leave a message. DG I won't blame you if you don't get that requested info to me.  I migrated to Windows 2000 and it had an old address book.  Sorry. DG Irena, One thing that would help me out the most is when new people start in the group, we have all of their applications and passwords ready to go.  Other than that, I think you guys do a great job.  Thanks. DG Everything is OK over here.  I heard about the spring game.  31K is alot of people for a game that doesn't count.

DG http://www. irs. ustreas. gov/elec_svs/ol-txpyr. html Is it really necessary to change the book names just to avoid confusion?  Who is confused?  Can't we just inform those who need to know that the Denver books are simply another desk that rolls up into the West Region?  I don't want to be difficult, but it will require a great deal of time and effort to change every deal in the Denver books to a new name.  Let me know what you think. DG
