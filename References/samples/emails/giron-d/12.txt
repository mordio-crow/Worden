There are two Tagg books that need to be mapped to this:  FT-DENVER and INTRA-DENVER.  The following people in Risk need access to the book:  Darron Giron, Chris Walker, Pat Ryder, Jason Wolfe, Carole Frank, Anne Bike, and Jennifer Bagwell.  I also want it to roll up into ALL-WEST.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks for your help. DG    3-9573 We have two new Analysts in this group, and therefore should probably go to this.  I nominate the two of you.
