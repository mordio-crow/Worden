just so you know, Kevin's reported P&L was understated by the $188K on the OA Flash tab.  He made an error in the sharing calculation. DG Shawn, Unfortunately, I am out of the office this morning with a sick kid.  I will not be able to make the 10:30am interview.  I appologize for the short notice. DG Yes we did. DG Jay, I changed the FTS monthly amount from $1,065 to $715 as previously discussed.  It is effective Feb 20th.  I need to change the amount transferred to account  586-61L86 from $150 to $175 and to account 586-61M19 from $175 to $200.  I also submitted a transfer of $1,000 into my CMA account.  I would like to transfer $500 each into account 586-94017 and account 586-94019.  This is my 2001 contribution to the Education IRA's.  Let me know if I need to do anything else.  Also, when are the recharacterizations from Roth to Traditional going to take place?  I will need a 1099-R for the transactions I think.  Call me if you have any questions.  Thanks. DG West is done.

I love you too. Guess who was at JV yesterday?  aTm coaches.  Seems like we have been losing some players lately.  How do we stand?

So I don't know if they actually pulled the offer, but it sure sounds like it.  Either way, the coach told my wife he will not be a Horn.  The coach is really dissapointed in AR.
