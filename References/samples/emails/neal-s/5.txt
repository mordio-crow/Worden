glad to hear from you.  Yes, Sao Paulo is muy grande con muchos macacos.  Everything is going fine here.  Do you have any trips to the US planned?  I have not be playing much golf, too cold and rainy here so far this winter, but spring is near. Stay in touch and good luck. Scott Let's try to visit on Thursday or Friday in the afternoon. Colton and I will be there some time during the day on Saturday and will spend the night.

Given the proximity of the park to our neighborhood (less than 1 hr away), most everyone (like me! ) will be coming and going to meet other commitments back at home - SO THAT'S NO EXCUSE ! ! ! To refresh your memories,  the itinerary for the weekend is get to the park Friday after school and set up before dark.  (For those who need to go down there later (Sat morning or afternoon) the location of our campsite will be at the entrance to the park. )  Once we get there, the activities are bicycle riding, touch football, fishing (bring your own gear) and boys playing grab-ass in general.  THE ONLY SCHEDULED EVENTS ARE A DINNER SATURDAY NIGHT,  A TRIP TO THE PARK'S OBSERVATORY SATURDAY NIGHT  AND BREAKFAST SUNDAY AM.  For food purposes, we need to know an accurate headcount for Saturday night and Sunday morning. If you need help getting your bikes to the park, get with Butch, he's looking into getting a trailer (or something).  We can settle-up on food, campsite rentals, lottery tickets, . . . when we get there.  Maps for those who need them will be provided next week. Oh yes, this is real camping, as in tents, sleeping bags, flashlights,lanterns, etc.  Please feel free to bring snacks and drinks. Of course, this is all subject to weather cooperating.  We'll make the final call on that by Thursday. To date, below is the headcount: Friday Night   Saturday Night Fallick        ?         ? Stehr          ?         Yes Byrd      ?
