One of the questions included in the Culture Audit is "What makes your company unique? "  If you were asked this question, how would you respond?  Please send me your answer by Thursday, July 20.   Thanks. Mary CP, please forward quote to JDF for their consideration. mike It looks fine. Thanks, mike Jeannie, Thanks for asking about my dad, he is doing very well after surgery which we believe was successful. My kids loved it.  The really enjoyed learning about Dad's work and what I do.  I think that this is a very important event because we all spend so much time here at Enron.  I have two children Claire - 9  and Michael - 6. They both look forward to the event and talk about it for weeks prior to the actual day.  Actually my daughter talks about it all year long.  Also they really can identify with Enron and talk more about it because of events like these. Mike Jay, Howdy from Houston.  I bet it is cooler in NY. I don't really have any other ideas as you addressed below except I changed the word "his" to "the" investment group.  As far as other clarification of duties, I don't have any issue with it, but every CEO will call me and ask if this is a change in how they deal with Alan or investments.  What is the status with Steve and how the group is organized?  Did you talk with him and let him know that he is a stand alone dealmaker with an area of concentration? Is that your official assigned work number?  If not, we need to get one assigned before the email goes out.  Also, I am assuming that this is in the MG office not the small Enron office, is that accurate?  Greg and I both think that the MG office is the best location and will help them assimilate with Enron.
