Pam, I'm following up on a few old items.  Did you get what you needed here?  I was in Asia when I originally got this and didn't hear anything back on this. Thanks, mike Allan, Please call Fred and discuss. Thanks, mike PB, I just talked with Cindy Olsen about the project.  We need to assign someone in our group to be the technology lead.  I know we have people on it but we need to pick someone to be responsible and then  clarify that person's role.  Please get back to me with the selection. Thanks, mike John, Howdy from Houston.  I received a call from a guy named Steve Scott who is involved with several ventures including a German VC  called eStreet.  Are you aware of these guys?  They want to talk to someone about e-opportunties in Europe especially Spain.  I will ask  him to call you once I talk with him but I don't have your number in London.  Two questions, what is your  phone number in London (the phone book has you in Germany) and do you know these guys?
