Mike I don't think you got a copy of this. mike Andrew, please make sure Jeff gets a copy of all of everything.  He is the Office of the Chairman sponor of the vertical and will be managing this process with Greg Piper until launch.  I stepped in while he was out of town on holiday. They look fine to me.

The purpose of the separate releases (the counterparties will make their own releases in addition) is to communicate the message that our goal is to continue to increase liquidity.  One way to do that is give the greatest possible number of  buyers and sellers the opportunity to see our prices. Please send any comments to me by 9:00 AM CDT tomorrow, July 12, 2000.
