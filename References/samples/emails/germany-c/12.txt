ENA is responsible for purchases of 500 MCFD (515 DthD) Metered Prouction from Phillips Production Company.  This volume is will be decreased  until further notice because PNG has increased line pressures thus reducing the production volumes to 50-60% of normal (Refer to attached schedule).  There are 7 Phillips meters  in CES's pool beginning July 2000.  Heidi Boyd @ CES will have to nominate the production into CES's pool and away from the pool until the meters are moved.  EES should have 6 Phillips Production meters in their pool beginning July 2000. 2.  See Attached Schedule for Term, Price & Volume.  Note:  PNG has increased line pressures which reduces production into the system.  Both Phillips Production and Power Gas Marketing are claiming Force Majeure.  Their volumes have been reduced to 50-60% of the original contractd volume.

Paul Leanza (Clinton) has a customer that can take around 1,000 day.  I don't know if that's dt or mcf.  I will use mcf for this email until someone corrects me.  This customer has a special deal where the pool operator gets a fuel credit on every mcf the customer pulls.  For July, assuming the gathering fuel is 5%, and this customer pulls 95 mcf from your production pool, you will get a 5 mcf credited back to your imbalance account the following month.  I don't know how this works with trading imbalances.  But, at a NYMX of $3.95 that works out to $.21 - sounds good to me.  Paul said this customer is looking for a CNG Index Flat price or and equivalent basis number.  Marde will not sell at that price but I will. Marde said she would charge ENA a $.03 fee for all the volumes flowing.  Actually, I would prefer to move all the pool and production gas to EES, settle up financially with EES and be done with it.  What we could do to test Paul's statement, is have the customer pull 300 mcf/day out of CES's pool for July.  It would be easy to see since that is the only deal.   AND, have EES take over the pool deal with Power Gas Marketing.  Comments / Questions? Questions John 1.  Heidi (EES) said you already have some Phillips production in EES's pool.  Does CES still have metered production from Phillips in CES's pool?  If yes, how many meters? 2.  Please give me the following info for the activity behind Peoples Phillips   Power Gas Marketing Term Price Volume Heidi (EES) If we find out from John that there is still metered production in CES's pool, please call Peoples and see if we can move the metered production to EES's pool for July.  Heidi Boyd with CES said you could tell them that CES is going out of
