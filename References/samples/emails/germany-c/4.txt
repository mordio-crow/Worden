EES and ENA used corporate guarantees.  Also, should I set up ENA as agent (when I do this I prefer to be the billing and nominating agent)?  Where is my free lunch and my New Power golf shirt? I just changed the rate on Tenn/transport uage deal 235293 from $.11 to $.0116.  We should get back 85,155 x $.0984==$8,300 tonight. Dan does not know what this contract is used for.  I think it has (or had) something to do with the Boston Gas contract.  We currently use k#29667 for that.  I would like to terminate deal 77257 effective 6/30/2000. Comments / questions? james r barker ees      patricia downey ees donnie myers/na/enron ENA sold EES 5,000 dth a day delivered on Iroq Zone 1.  The price is $3.14.  The total volume is 150,000 for the month.  Patricia is only showing a purchase in your system of 140,000 for the month.  I think you forgot to put in some of the buy/sale activity. My system shows ENA delivered 130,000 to Canajoharie and 5,000 to Tenn-Wright one day (you though little ol' ENA was taking advantage of you).  For 3 days we bought the gas back from you and we are showing the buy/sale activity at Tenn-Wright.  The total buy/sale volume is 15,000.  I think you need to add another 10,000 to your buy/sale activity. Let me know if you have any questions.  Buddy Hi Steph, I don't know if this question should go to you.  If not, please forward it on to the right person and let me know who that is. The reservation volumes on the seasonal contracts do not look correct.  The demand charge looks OK, its the demand volume which is not calculating correctly.  And ENA has released this capacity to Energy Express effective June 1. Please look at the following contracts/deals.

I just had a thought.  Just to keep you guys in the loop, I will send this type of stuff to you unless you tell me not too.  You don't need to do anything with it.  Its more of an awareness type thing. I have to look for the house key at home.  I know I don't have it on my keyring. EB3224b I just changed the rate on Algon/transport
