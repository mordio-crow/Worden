I will try to find out this afternoon exactly what EES is doing and give you an update. FYI.  Also take a look at today's Gas Daily Hey, send them again.  I don't have them. 	 	 I have not discussed August forward with anyone yet.  I would like to discuss our options on handling the pool with Heidi, hopefully after the July 4th holiday.  I hope you guys have a happy 4th if I don't talk to you before. 	 	 This is what we have so far.

Robert, I entered a buy and a sale to capture the financial difference on CGAS, deals 318749 and 318750.  I may kill these deals if ENA purchases the gas back from CES at Mainline.  I'll keep you posted. For July, CES purchased 1,155 day from ENA at CGLF Mainline.  CES has enough FTS-1 to transport this gas to CGAS.

EES has the ability to take this gas for the term of the deal (through Oct 2000).  I told Marde we would talk about that after the 4th.  EES will nominate this gas directly from Power's pool, so Heidi does not need to be involved at all.   Heidi, it looks like this pool can be terminated. Peoples, for July ENA is selling 430/day to Clinton Energy (Latrobe).  Heidi is working on that.  Heidi also informed me yesterday that CES was terminating the Peoples pool effective 8/1/2000.  I suggested that we may need to transfer the pool to ENA, because there will still be activity in August due to the Latrobe fuel credit.  However, we may be able to transfer any balances to EES effectve 8/1/2000.  Hopefully, we can talk about this after the 4th. Let me know if anyone has any questions. JD is a dead man.   Are you going to give Kori a birthday smooch!
