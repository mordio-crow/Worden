to cost each of you depends on whether my ticket is Round 1 or 2.  If it's in round 2 each of you would pay $912 for the first two rounds, and if it's in round 1 each of you would pay $921.  If the two of you want all the playoff tickets, each of you would pay $1,098 for Rounds 1 and 2. This year the Rockets are saying that if the tickets are not used you can ask for a refund by the same means that you paid.  So what I would propose to do it put all the charges on my credit card and if they don't make the playoffs that charge will be reversed; and it may not even make it on my bill if they don't make the playoffs. Since I will put it on my card I won't need your money until about the 20th of April. So please let me know if you want to commit and whether you want me to take a ticket out of each of the sets of rounds. (I'm fine either way) Robert S. Baird Vinson & Elkins L. L. P.

Thank You I am ok with your slate, but need some Houston people on board as well.  I think we can shorten the Houston list by taking me off since John Novak will be on the board.  I leave it to Bruce to see if it makes sense to shorten the list further.

I would like to finalize before the next ordinary shareholder meeting in Brazil.   Thanks --------------- See attached regarding Elektro's board membership.  We would suggest that the board slate be made up of Brazil residents in order to facilitate the necessary meetings. I would like to include Joe Kishkill, John Novak, Brett Wiggs, Britaldo Soares and Joao Carlos Albuquerque, all members of our executive committee to substitute Rick Waddell, Diomedes, Jim Bannantine, and Rick Lammers.  If  you agree, I will talk to Rebecca to finalize.  Thanks You would need to start out in the associate program.  Good
