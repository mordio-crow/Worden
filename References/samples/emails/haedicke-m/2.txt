Mark 	Michelle Blaine/ENRON@enronXgate 	03/16/2001 01:48 PM 		 		 To: Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: John Novak/SA/Enron@Enron, Sami Arap/SA/Enron@Enron, Rob Walls/ENRON@enronXgate, Robert C Williams/ENRON@enronXgate 		 Subject: FW: arbitration for Brazilian PPAs Hi Mark, Sami Arap, John Novak & I are in the process of developing a new matrix for arbitration in Brazil on certain types of trading contracts for your approval.   Until that is complete, however, Sami & John have identified the following spot market contracts as needing immediate approval for dispute resolution clauses agreeing to ICC administered arbitration in Sao Paulo or Rio.  As you are aware, this is somewhat contrary to our traditional policy for out of country ICC arbitration.  The counter parties in these transactions will not agree to arbitration outside Brazil.  Given the nature of these contracts, I believe ICC administered arbitration in Brazil is an acceptable means for dispute resolution.  I've discussed this with Rob and he is in agreement subject to your approval. Regards, Michelle Please schedule lunch in late April.   Mark Tim: Thanks!  I am working on getting Steve even more locked up.  Mark 	Tim Belden John: I gave you a rewrite of Redman's list and the percentages.  I will send it again in case it got lost.
