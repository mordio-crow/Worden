Mark and Rob: Rockets have been looking good (despite the recent slump) and have a chance to make the playoffs.  (I heard on the radio this morning that Hakeem may be back. )  So the Rockets have sent out invoices for playoff tickets.  We are supposed to respond by this Friday, March 30. This year (perhaps because they know there's a decent chance they won't make the playoffs) the Rockets are invoicing playoff tickets in two installments. The first installment covers rounds one and two, and the second covers the Western Conference Finals and the NBA Championship. I can't tell whether if you commit for the first two rounds you have a legal obligation to buy the second and third if they make it to the Western Conference Finals, but I assume that doesn't matter (we should assume that a commitment now means a financial commitment for the entire playoffs). Rounds 1 and 2 encompass 6 games.  $549 per seat, or $2,196 total.  That's two games in Round 1 at $88.50 per ticket, and four games in Round 2 at $93.00 per ticket. Rounds 3 and 4 (which we wouldn't have to pay for until later) are $916 per seat, or $3,664.  I assume that Rounds 3 and 4 will include 8 games. For the regular season I had 6/44 of the tickets, which is 13.6%.  That's approximately 1 ticket in Rounds 1 and 2 and 1 ticket in Rounds 3 and 4. I'd be glad to spring for that, although if you all want all the playoff tickets that's fine also. So I suppose how much it's going
