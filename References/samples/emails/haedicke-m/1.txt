Thanks.  Please don't hold up the meeting for me but if possible I will attend.  Mark 	Christian Yoder 	03/07/2001 12:20 PM 		 		 To: Elizabeth Sager/HOU/ECT@ECT, Mark E Haedicke/HOU/ECT@ECT, Richard B Sanders/HOU/ECT@ECT 		 cc: Tim Belden/HOU/ECT@ECT, Steve C Hall/PDX/ECT@ECT 		 Subject: Legal strategy for summer in the west Tim agrees that a half day legal strategy session about the pending summer melt down should happen sooner rather than later.   I understand that Richard and Elizabeth are scheduling a trip to Portland for the first week in April.  I will coordinate their schedules with Tim's and tie down the details.  Here is what I intend to do in the meantime.  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated: Get our major summer trading positions identified and get the contractual underpinings organized.  This is something that Kim Theriot's group can help us with. Meet with our  fundamentals leader and our head scheduler to try to understand as much as we can about how  shortage scenarios might unfold and what power flow behavior at the key delivery points might look like.  Meet with Steve Walters of Stoel Rives to get his mind focussed on big picture early positioning moves we might wish to take with BPA. Get Marcus Wood to help us refine our understanding of BPA Surplus firm and Excess Federal Power and how BPA might reasonably be expected to act with respect to each. Get credit to figure out if there is anyway we can get BPA to post a large amount of LC collateral to us.  ----cgy Peter: As we have discussed, I think we probably need someone other than Dan.  I don't think there is any need to lay everything out on use of lawyers in Canada.  I agree with your comments on the business model for lawyers.  We can't ignore that.  Let's generally talk that through with Jim. Regards, Mark 	Peter Keohane Thanks for the heads up!  Mark Greg:  Thanks.  Was a dash done on this?

The acquisition will be made pursuant to a standard long form subscription agreement.  Impact Energy is a publicly traded Canadian junior oil and gas company (trades on the TSE under the symbol TEY), which resulted from the reorganization of Startech Energy by and with ARC Energy in January 2001.  Kyle plans on subscribing for 545,455 common shares at a price per share of CDN$0.55, for total consideration of $300,000.25.  Under Canadian securities legislation, there will be a hold period imposed on the shares of one year from the date of issuance of the shares, meaning that Enron Canada will be prevented from reselling the shares in the open market
