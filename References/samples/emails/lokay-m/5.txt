being prepared and will be distributed to you a week prior to the class.  I hope you can attend.  Similar industry classes can cost upwards of $600 per student.   Our customized class can accommodate up to 100 attendees.   Please RSVP to Ruth Mann by email by August 8 if you plan to attend.  Once I get a count of attendees from this list, I will open the class up to other GPG attendees.  Good.

The first date Kim, Lindy, Sean and I could make was Friday August 18th.  How does everyone else's schedule look for the morning of the 18th? Hi Mike, Great to hear from you.  Would have gotten back to you sooner, but we just got back from vacationing in California.  Sure was tough to leave temperatures in the 60s and return to the 90s! How are things going?  Did they ever implement Modular Forecasting?  Bet you love those Displays!  Sounds like you guys are pretty busy. . . too busy to be speculating about me!  I am in marketing for Enron, using my trading and financial background.  The timing was perfect and my commute is so much shorter! Keep in touch. . . and shouldn't the Aggies be in the Top 20? ! ? ! "Triem, Mike" <Mike. Triem@COMPAQ. com> on 07/26/2000 08:41:25 AM To: "'Michelle Lokay'" <mlokay@enron. com> cc:  Subject: How are you doing? ? Michelle, Since I didn't get to say good-bye, I wanted to see how you were doing?  It sounds like you landed on your feet pretty fast.  To be nosey, were you able to get a severance package and then become employed that quickly?  The speculation around here was that you already had the Enron job (i. e. , may have given notice already) and Will severed you because of the soft landing scheduled (heck, I would have loved to be in your situation). I guess you know that Will officially left the company.  Another speculation was that he tried to garner a severance package himself, but they turned him down (of course he was furious, but I don't know if it was true). What exactly are you doing with Enron?  Is it in a Marketing role?  Randa mentioned that you are travelling some, but didn't really know what your job function entailed. Periodically keep in touch because inquiring minds like to know (and I might use you for some research). Regards, Mike Triem NA IPAQ & Displays Business Planning Mgr. 281.927.8586 FYI. . . I am scheduled for Jury Duty next Monday, August 14. Vacation week of July 31- August 4.  Jury Duty on August 14.  Thanks. Hi Teresa, Believe it or
