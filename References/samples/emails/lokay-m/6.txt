Hello Marketing, I'm looking for feedback regarding the TW Deal Profitability model.  There were some problems a few weeks ago but I'm assuming they have been resolved since no one is saying anything. Have there been any problems accessing the website?  Are there any issues you'd like to raise?  The sooner I know, the sooner we can get started on improving/troubleshooting the model. I'm not sure I have all the users on the mailing list so please inform those I may have inadvertently left out.  I look forward to hearing from you. Thanks, Ken x36317 What do you think about Capstone Turbines? Mark, Here is the electronic form for the Interconnect and Operating Agreement for your legal folks.  Talk to you soon!
