is committed to writing (most of it is exchanged in person or over the phone).  This is, I believe, what lies at the heart of complaints about cross-department communication.  We now have some solutions emerging -- software that enables more people to record and post information in HTML format on company intranet sites.  I suspect that using such tools will face two obstacles: learning how to use them (ie there's a huge need for training) and making it part of our culture as a knowledge/learning organization Richard Amabile 08/18/2000 05:20 PM To: Mike McConnell/HOU/ECT@ECT, Louise Kitchen/HOU/ECT@ECT, David Gorte/HOU/ECT@ECT, Cindy Olson/Corp/Enron@ENRON, James Prentice/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON, Jan Johnson/GPGFIN/Enron@ENRON, Mark Koenig/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Sharon Butcher/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Mary Clark/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Gina Taylor/OTS/Enron@Enron, Mike Stewart/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Dave Schafer/OTS/Enron@ENRON, David A Terlip/Corp/Enron@Enron, Joe Kishkill/SA/Enron@Enron, Marie Hejka/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Craig Childers/HOU/EES@EES, Craig H Sutter/HOU/EES@EES, Kirk McDaniel/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Kathleen A Cook/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, John Ambler/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Keith Sparks/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, James C Lewis/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Ray Bennett/HOU/EES@EES, Joseph W Sutton/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, George Wasaff/NA/Enron@Enron, Elizabeth Tilney/HOU/EES@EES, Michael R Brown/LON/ECT@ECT, Andrew S Fastow/HOU/ECT@ECT, Billy Lemmons/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Steven J Kean/HOU/EES@EES, Scott Yeager@ees, Eric Thode/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Marie Hejka/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cynthia Barrow/HR/Corp/Enron@ENRON, John Thompson/LON/ECT@ECT, Nigel Sellens/LON/ECT@ECT, David Oxley/HOU/ECT@ECT, Drew C Lynch/LON/ECT@ECT, Marla Barnard/Enron Communications@Enron Communications, robert. jones@enron. com, Kimberly Rizzi/HOU/ECT@ECT, Scott Gilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Janie Bonnard/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, willie. williams@enron. com, Scott Gilchrist/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT, Tim O'Rourke/Corp/Enron@Enron, Miguel Padron/SA/Enron@Enron, Gerry Chatham/Corp/Enron@ENRON, Cindy Skinner/HOU/ECT@ECT, Ranendra Sengupta/ENRON_DEVELOPMENT@ENRON_DEVELOPMENT cc: ksargent@cognitivearts. com Subject: Computer Based Communications Training Initiative - Response Reminder for Feedback This is a reminder that we would like your feedback/input on the items mentioned below regarding the Computer Based Communications Training Initiative.  Please respond by the close of business Monday, August 21 otherwise we will need to move ahead with the responses received by that time. Dick Amabile My message cut off. . .  The conclusion is that while we continue to need to address the kinds of issues laid out in your recommnedations, we need to look at solutions which may go deeper to adress our communications problems . . .  solutions which have become available only recently.  Why not have these guys focus on an online training program to both teach people how to make information available and accessible (eg by recording information and updating on the intranet) and demonstrating the importance of this activity to the success of the organization. I think you and your team have done a fine job dealing with the traditional (and perhaps largely insoluble problems) that this group wants to take on.  I am pessimistic that the program outlined below will provide anything other than marginal improvements.   I am somewhat optimistic, though, that we may be able to bypass many of these problems (and get to the heart of what people are really complaining about in the survey) by instituting real knowledge management at Enron.
