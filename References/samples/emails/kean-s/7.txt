study using recent data as part of his role for the Market Surveillance Committee, had done a study.  There was some discussion, though not much, of the monopsony power of the utilities.  I think ultimately the group conceded that scarcity of supply amplified concerns about the exercise of market power, as even the increase in gas costs did not fully explain the recent spikes.  Wolak believes that encourage utilities to enter into forward purchases will reduce the exercise of real-time market power. Hogan seemed to be there with Sempra's interests in mind.  He continued to promote expansion of the ISO's abilities to dispatch load as well as maintain system reliability.  There was alot of discussion about forward purchase ability for utilities so as to be less subject to volatile market prices.  The concerns were also discussed about the appropriateness of a distribution utility making purchasing decisions on behalf of its customers.  This included discussion of separation of these functions and the default provider role.  Most everyone agreed that rolling back to a regulated market was not feasible without raising other major and serious concerns, however there seemed to be support for some interim measures where cost-of-service regulation may be a good idea and that was during peak periods.  All agreed that a demand response, and price signals, are important in the long-run, although not to the extent currently experienced in San Diego. Today's panel included representatives from SDG&E, SCE and PG&E, TURN, UCAN and ORA.  While yesterday's panel maintained objectivity as to whether or not generators were exercising market power to the detriment of the system, today's panel made no bones about the generators being to blame. SCE/PG&E indicated their need for relief for recovery of market costs in excess of the rate freeze.  SDG&E was still on the hot seat for their inaction in hedging any of their supply.  SDG&E brought up their failed PBR proposal and ORA and UCAN thought that that may be one way to incent the utility to be more responsible with their purchases. UCAN discussed the Governor's direction and the potential for putting rate caps into affect for residential and small commercial.  He mentioned that C&I customers are experience difficulties as well.  TURN raised the need for cost-based bid caps and cost-based peaking contracts.  Mike Florio, TURN, urged against any further divestitute of assets and alleged market concentration on those assets that had been divested.  In fact, TURN urged the Commission to seek legislation to clarify the Commission's authority to order retention of assets. Neeper urged that part of the solution should be changing the current requirement to use the PX as the only authorized exchange, although TURN disagreed.
