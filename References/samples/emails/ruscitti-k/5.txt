you as always.  It'll be great to have you back in the states.  By the way, I attached a copy of the boys. I hope it comes across OK. Talk to you soon. Kevin - DCP00617. BMP Great to hear from you.  Things have been going well in Houston.  Lisa is working for Johnson Controls. It must be a long time since we've talked b/c she's been with Johnson for about 5 months.  I love my new job - I'm trading gas up in the Midwest market area - Illinois and Michigan.  Things have been incredibly busy. The wedding plans have changed considerably.  As I'm sure you can relate to, the stress of planning combined with the input of so many others have made us decide to have a wedding with only our folks there and not even have a reception.   We figured we could put the money toward a house and save a lot of anger, frustration and stress. How's the job, new house, and Terri doing?  Have you been to many Bears games?  The Scarlet Knights have been so inconsistent this year.  I think a lot is due to their youth. Let's talk soon. Kevin Anne Marie, Unfortunately, it doesn't look like I'll be able to interview at UCLA on the 11th. Keep me in mind for next time though. Kevin Murli, Great to hear from you.  I'm glad you accepted the offer - I'm sure you'll enjoy you're experience at Enron.  Good luck during your final semester. Kevin That is if you ever get you LLC set up.  Look forward to trading with you in 2001. KR Joke, huh? Davis, Let me know if this helps. kevin If I understand you correctly, it may depend to an extent on season basis differentials as well. Why don't you give me a call so I could better understand what you're trying to do. Kevin x3-6320 I received the email. Thanks, kevin Dude, What's your work #.  I need to give you a call. Kevin T. J. , I need your LA address.  I'm sure I have it some place but I can't find it. How's everything going?  How's Rena?  Are you heading home for the holidays or staying in LA?
