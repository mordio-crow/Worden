The Energies Plan encouraged energy saving, funded technological innovation and pursued "maximum exploitation of renewable resources with a view to diversify the supply sources and replacing the more polluting fuels." (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1778).  Today, Navarre produces around 60% of its electricity with a combination of wind power and small hydropower stations.  Navarre is also home to the largest solar plant (1.2MWp) in Spain (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1776).  As specifics about Navarre's renewable technologies are discussed below, it is important to remember that, in contrast to many nations and regions that build renewable systems with the ultimate goal of 'clean energy,' Navarre is pursuing and maintaing self-sufficiency through decentralized, clean energy (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1778).
	Navarre underwent an amazing wind turbine construction boom in the late 1990s, with 233 turbines installed in 1998 alone. There are approximately 1110 installed and operational wind turbines in the Autonomous Community today; that's over 10 turbines per 100-square kilometers with the average turbine size hovering around 1000kW; in 2001, 71% of energy in Navarre was generated with wind power  (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1778).  This number has since fallen, however, "overall production has risen by 100% from 2002 to 2003 and by 50% from 2003 to 2004" (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1778).
	Hydraulic power (hydropower), as mentioned above, was the main source of power for the Autonomous Community since the technology was developed.  Since 1997, hydropower output has remained stable, though new plants have been constructed.  Generally, these are very small plants and serve to replace plants that are closed down.  Currently, hydropower provides about 5.29% of Navarre's energy (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1780). 
	Biomass also figures prominently in Navarre's energy portfolio.  In 2004, biomass produced upwards of 5% of total energy generated (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1784).  Photovoltaic solar energy is one of the least exploited renewable energies in Navarre.  Though Navarre has 41% of the PV installations in Spain and produces 48% of Spain's PV energy, PV cells only make up about 0.09% of the Community's total energy production(Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1783).  
	These energy revolutions saw a 300% increase in electricity generation between 1996 and 2001.  Overall, this has meant that Navarre has gone from importing over 85% of their electricity  in 1995 to exporting over 34% of their production in 2004 (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1790).  Not only have the citizens of Navarre been able to free themselves from reliance on foreign energy, but they have been able to do it without reliance on conventional systems or nuclear power.  
	These shifts are important in a place like Navarre, a historical region with a strong sense of independence; it shares many cultural trappings with the more well-known Autonomous Community to it East, the Basque Country.  To be able to control the way their energy is produced and through use of their local resources (coastal winds, mountains) is important in a culture that reveries is strong ties to the land.
