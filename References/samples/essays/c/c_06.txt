Jos√© Borrell, minister of the former Ministry of Public Works, Transportation and Environment had, on multiple occasions, publicly addressed the need to establish more economically efficient environmental policy tools (Fernändez 1998: 127).  His successor in the environmental field, Isabel Tocino, used her first public appearance as the head of the newly created Ministry of the Environment to emphasize her willingness to promote such polices.  She stressed the gradual application of economic and financial incentives, polluter-pays principles and an analysis of ecological taxes (Fernändez 1998: 128).
	The pressure exerted by the new legislation also led to a broad decentralization of many environmental responsibilities.  In fact, the delegation of numerous environmental activities to the regional governments of Spain may prove to be the most important step Spain has taken to address environmental policy creation issues.  As laid out in the 1978 Constitution, Spain is divided into seventeen autonomous regions, with varying levels of independence and legislative power.  While national policy coherence may suffer from this division, the increased cost-effectiveness and greater level of regional policy relevancy stands to yield more effective implementation.  As an OECD environmental performance review recommended, "streamlining and codifying the very large body of environmental laws and regulations would facilitate enforcement and implementation by lower levels of government" (OECD 1997: 18).  In fact, some regions have gone beyond national directives and have developed "fairly advanced approaches to environmental protection along the lines of sustainable development" (Pridham and Konstadakopulos 1997: 144).  For example, as of mid-1991, 11 regions had passed laws enabling "stricter-than-national applications of the EU directive on the protection of birds" (OECD 1997: 125). As of the same date, nine regions had stricter laws governing environmental impact assessments (EIA) (OECD 1997: 125).   
	These "bottom-up" efforts - at regional and even municipal levels - have allowed communities to adapt and create policy particular to the idiosyncrasies of their location.  Furthermore, while the level of autonomy with regards to environmental policy varies from region to region, center-periphery cooperation is nearly guaranteed in Spain's semi-federal system.  Additionally, these more regionalized approaches help to lessen the impact of a serious trust problem prevalent in Spain, a problem that is having severe effects on the creation of Spanish environmental policy.  A national party functionary responsible for environmental concerns explains,
As mentioned above, the decentralized political system in Spain led to some regions creating environmental polices far stricter that national standards.  The autonomous community of Navarre is one of these.
	From its inception and through the 1980s, Navarre's energy system was largely fueled by small hydropower stations and conventional thermal combustion engines (Gonzalez et al. 2007: 1777).  Both of these systems were generally small, with hydropower stations usually sized under 2 MW and conventional combustion, usually "small boilers for in-house use in companies, which sold any surplus energy" (Gonzalez et al. 2007:1777).  Following Spain's 1986 accession to the EU, as environmental issues and notions of clean energy began to appear on the Spanish policy landscape, Navarre produced its 1996 "Renewable Energies Plan" with the goal of 100% renewable energy generation by 2010.
